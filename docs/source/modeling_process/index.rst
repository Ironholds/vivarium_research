=============================
The Vivarium Modeling Process
=============================

The Simulation Science team is actively working on building out and improving a
model development process to guide the interactions between researchers and
software engineers. This documentation is generated collaboratively during
weekly documentation sessions which has a guide `here <process_documentation>`.


Additional model development process is migrating here from the
Hub. Until then, you can still find the process documentation there!
