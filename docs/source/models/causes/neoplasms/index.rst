Neoplasm (Cancer) Cause Models
==============================
In GBD, a general framework has been used to model all malignant cancers. They have same sequelae to estimate disability 
(diagnosis_and_primary_therapy, controlled_phase, metastatic_phase and terminal_phase). 

Even though each cancer is unique in its own way, to reduce the redundant documentation, the cancers that have same kind of sequelae 
and modeled at the same level are merged and documented as *Cancers*. Those that could not be combined with these are documented separately.

The causes that are documented unders *Cancers* are:

- Tracheal, bronchus and lung cancer 
- Cervical cancer 
- Stomach Cancer
- Kidney cancer 
- Gallbladder and biliary tract cancer 
- Esophageal cancer 
- Pancreatic cancer 
- Thyroid cancer 
- Non-hodgkin lymphoma 
- Multiple myeloma 
- Other pharynx cancer 
- Nasopharynx cancer 
- Lip and oral cavity cancer 
- Ovarian cancer
- Uterine cancer
