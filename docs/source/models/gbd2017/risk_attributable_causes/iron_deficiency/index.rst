Dietary Iron Deficiency (Iron Deficiency Anemia)
================================================

Disease Description
-------------------

Generally, **anemia** is a condition defined by a deficiency of red blood cells 
or a deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood. Anemia is typically classified by 
hemoglobin concentrations below a defined threshold that varies by age and sex. 
Severity of anemia is similarly classified according to ranges of hemoglobin 
concentrations. Anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality and 
symptoms of anemia often include weakness, fatigue, and difficulty 
concentrating.

 Notably, anemia may be caused by many diverse factors. Examples of factors 
 that may cause anemia include genetic mutations in hemoglobin genes, acute or 
 chronic blood loss, altered red blood cell morphology, inadequate nutritional 
 intake, and others.

**Iron deficiency anemia** is a type of anemia that is due to insufficient 
iron levels, which lead to a deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood. Notably, 
iron deficiency anemia can occur when dietary intake of iron is insufficient, 
although it may occur in other situations as well, such as when iron is lost 
through bleeding (ex: menstrual disorders, hookworm disease, etc.). Iron 
deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia globally in most 
populations.

**Dietary iron deficiency anemia** is a specific type of iron deficiency anemia 
that is due to inadequate dietary intake of iron, leading to inadequate iron 
levels in the body and a subsequent deficiency of hemoglobin in the blood.
