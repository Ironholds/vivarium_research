Case definition in GBD 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Preterm birth is defined as live birth before 37 completed weeks of gestation.
In our analysis, we further break down this cause into three sub-categories of
preterm birth, based on gestational age: extremely preterm (<28 weeks), very
preterm (28 to <32 weeks), and moderate to late preterm (32 to <37 weeks). These
categories are based on the World Health Organization (WHO) definition of
preterm birth.
