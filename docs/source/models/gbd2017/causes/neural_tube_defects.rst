Neural Tube Defects (NTDs)
==========================

Disease Description
-------------------

Neural tube defects occur when neural tube fails to close completely during development. The GBD 2017 case definition includes **spina bifida**, in which part of the spinal cord and/or meninges are uncovered by skin; **encephalocele**, a congenital defect characterized by sac-like protrusions of the brain and meninges through openings in the skull; and **anencephaly**, the absence of a major portion of the brain, skull, and scalp. *Spina bifida occulta*, a much less severe form of spina bifida where the defect in vertebral column remains covered by skin, is excluded from the GBD case definition of spina bifida.

All infants born with anencephaly die during the first few weeks of life, as there is no remission and no cure for this condition. Infants born with spina bifida or encephalocele typically require surgical intervention during the first few weeks of life, and thereafter may experience a range of neural and motor complications. Our case definitions of spina bifida and encephalocele do not consider surgical intervention for either condition as remission.

Spina bifida corresponds to the ICD-10_ codes Q05.0, Q05.4,Q05.6, Q05.7, Q05.8, and Q05.9. Encephalocele corresponds to the ICD-10 codes Q01.2, Q01.8, and Q01.9. Anencephaly corresponds to the ICD-10 codes Q00.0 and Q00.2. [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_

Modeling Neural Tube Defects in GBD 2017
----------------------------

In GBD 2017, spina bifida, encephalocele, and anencephaly are each modelled separately and then fit to a total model of all neural tube defects.

.. todo::

   Add relevant detail about NTD modeling process from
   [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_ and from the `CoD Capstone
   <http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(18)32203-7>`_ Appendix.

Cause Model Diagram
-------------------

.. todo::

   Add Vivarium cause model diagram.

Model Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------------

This model is designed to be used for estimating DALYs due to NTDs that are
averted from an intervention that directly reduces the prevalence of neural tube defects, such as large-scale fortification of flour with folic acid, or targeted folic acid supplementation during pregnancy.

.. todo::

   Describe more assumptions and limitations of the model.

Data Description
----------------

.. todo::

   Add tables describing data sources for the Vivarium model.

Validation Criteria
-------------------

.. todo::

   Describe tests for model validation.
