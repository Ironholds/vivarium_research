Ischemic Heart Disease
======================

Disease Description
-------------------

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a non-communicable cardiovascular disease which occurs when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. Since 1990, this disease has been a leading cause of global Years of Life Lost (YLL). GBD 2017 listed IHD as the leading cause of YLLs globally, with a mean percentage increase in 3.9% in all-age YLL rate since 2007. According to NIH_, IHD is also known as Coronary Artery Disease, Coronary Heart Disease, Coronary Microvascular Disease. Symptomps and complications can vary by person, even if they have the same type of ischemic heart disease. Reported symptoms vary whether a person is experiencing an acute coronary event, such as a heart attack, or has chronic IHD. Symptoms may get worse as the buildup of plague continues to narrow the coronary arteries.

Acute coronary events may cause symptoms such as angina, cold sweats, dizziness, nausuea, neckpain, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, or weakness. 

Chronic ischemic heart disease can cause signs and symptoms such as angina, anxiety or nervousness, fatigue, or neckpace.
