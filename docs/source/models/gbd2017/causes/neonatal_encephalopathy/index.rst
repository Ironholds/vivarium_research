Case definition in GBD 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) due to birth asphyxia and birth trauma, also called
hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, is defined as injury to the brain in the first
few moments or days of life in an infant born at term. NE has multiple
aetiologies and is defined more by its symptoms -- abnormal neurological
function, including reduced level of consciousness, seizures, depression of tone
and reflexes, or difficulty maintaining respiration -- than its origin. NE can
occur when an infant is deprived of oxygen during delivery or sustains physical
trauma to the head, among other causes.
