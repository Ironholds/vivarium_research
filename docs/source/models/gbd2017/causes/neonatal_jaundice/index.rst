Disease Description
-------------------

Case definition in GBD 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++



`Haemolytic disease of the newborn`_ and other `neonatal jaundice`_ refers to
several aetiologies by which an infant develops extreme hyperbilirubinemia_
(EHB) and can then go on to develop kernicterus_. The aetiologies that we model
for GBD are EHB from `Rhesus (Rh) disease`_, preterm birth,
`glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency`_ (G6PD), and other causes.
