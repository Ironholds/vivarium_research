Modeling other neonatal disorders in GBD 2017
---------------------------------------------

Beginning of CoD Appendix
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Mortality for five causes are modeled within “neonatal disorders”: preterm birth
complications, neonatal encephalopathy and birth trauma, neonatal sepsis and
other infections, hemolytic disease and neonatal jaundice, and other neonatal
disorders. An overall neonatal disorders “parent” envelope is also estimated, to
which all neonatal causes are squeezed.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In addition to the neonatal disorders described above, there are many diverse
types of neonatal disorders with a range of severities and associated sequelae.
Because these other neonatal disorders are diverse in their underlying causes
and risk factors as well as in their associated health outcomes, modelling them
together in a DisMod-MR model would not produce reliable estimates of prevalence
or excess mortality. Instead, we calculated the YLDs caused by other neonatal
disorders directly using a YLD/YLL ratio.

We calculated the ratio of YLDs to YLLs across the specified neonatal disorders
for which non-fatal outcomes were modelled, using YLL estimates from the GBD
2017 cause of death (CoD) analysis. We then multiplied this YLD/YLL ratio by the
YLL estimates for other chronic respiratory diseases from the GBD 2017 CoD
analysis, providing us with an estimate of the YLDs associated with other
neonatal disorders.
