Case definition in GBD 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections are infections during the neonatal
period that advance to a systemic bloodstream infection, the underlying cause of
which can be meningitis, gastroenteritis, or other aetiologies. Neonatal
pneumonia, however, is not included -- it is captured in our modelling of
pneumonia as a separate entity.
