Disease Description
-------------------

Case definition in GBD 2017
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Neonatal sepsis and other neonatal infections are infections during the neonatal
period that advance to a systemic bloodstream infection, the underlying cause of
which can be meningitis, gastroenteritis, or other aetiologies. Neonatal
pneumonia, however, is not included -- it is captured in the modelling of
pneumonia as a separate entity.

   Add more information and references. In particular, find data about differences in global and 
   gbd definitions, global prevalence and relation to folic acid during pregnancy.

Modeling Measles in GBD 2017
----------------------------

It is worth noting that the ICD 10 and ICD 9 codes used in non-fatal and fatal GBD models are different. 
The ICD 10 codes used in non fatal model are P36-P36.9, P38-P39.9. K29.0-K29.00, K29.1-K29.20, P77-P78.1 
codes are also used in hospital/claims analyses of non fatal model The ICD 9 codes used are 771, 771.4-771.89. 
For hospital/claims analyses, 535.0-535.00, 535.3-535.30, 777.5-777.7 are also used in addition to the above mentioned ICD 9 codes.
While the fatal model uses only P36-P36.9, P38-P39.9 ICD 10 codes and 771.4-771.9 ICD 9 codes
