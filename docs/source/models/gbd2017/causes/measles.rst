Disease Description
===================

Measles_ is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by the
measles virus (*Measles morbillivirus*).
Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to the virus,
and last 7-10 days.
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and
a red, flat or blotchy skin rash that develops on average 14 days after
exposure to the virus (range, 7-21 days) and
lasts 5-6 days.
Recovery from measles results in lifelong immunity.
[WHO]_, [CDC]_, [Wikipedia]_, [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_.

Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated
with the disease.
The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis,
severe diarrhea, ear infections, and pneumonia.
Serious complications are more common in children under the age of 5
or adults over the age of 30, especially those with vitamin A deficiency
or those whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases [WHO]_.

Measles is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact, or direct
contact with infected nasal or throat secretions.
The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces
for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from
4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts
[WHO]_, [CDC]_, [Wikipedia]_.

Before the introduction of a measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination,
major epidemics occurred approximately every 2–3 years, and measles caused an
estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.
Despite the availibility of a vaccine,
approximately  110 000 people died from measles in 2017, mostly children
under the age of 5 years.
However, due to accelerated immunization activities,
global measles deaths have decreased 80% during the period 2000–2017,
from an estimated 545 000 to  110 000,
and measles vaccination prevented an estimated  21.1 million deaths
during 2000–2017 [WHO]_.

The `ICD 10`_ codes for measles are B05-B05.9, Z24.4,
and ICD 9 codes are 055-055.9, 484.0, V04.2, V73.2
