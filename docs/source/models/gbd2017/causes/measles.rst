Measles

Disease Description
===================

Measles_ is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by the
measles virus (*Measles morbillivirus*, in the paramyxovirus family).
The virus infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body.
Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.

Symptoms usually develop 10-12 days after exposure to the virus,
and last 7-10 days. [Wikipedia]_
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, conjunctivitis, and
a red, flat or blotchy rash that develops on average 14 days after
exposure to the virus (within a range of 7 to 18 days) and
lasts 5-6 days.

Most measles-related deaths are caused by complications associated
with the disease.
Serious complications are more common in children under the age of 5,
or adults over the age of 30.
The most serious complications include blindness, encephalitis,
severe diarrhea and related dehydration, ear infections,
and severe respiratory infections such as pneumonia.
Severe measles is more likely among poorly nourished young children,
especially those with insufficient vitamin A,
or whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS or other diseases.

Measles is one of the world’s most contagious diseases.
It is spread by coughing and sneezing, close personal contact or direct
contact with infected nasal or throat secretions.
The virus remains active and contagious in the air or on infected surfaces
for up to 2 hours. It can be transmitted by an infected person from
4 days prior to the onset of the rash to 4 days after the rash erupts.

Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination,
major epidemics occurred approximately every 2–3 years and measles caused an
estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.

Approximately  110 000 people died from measles in 2017 – mostly children
under the age of 5 years, despite the availability of a safe and effective
vaccine.
Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on
reducing measles deaths. During 2000– 2017, measles vaccination prevented
an estimated  21.1 million deaths. Global measles deaths have decreased
by  80% from an estimated  545 000 in 2000* to  110 000 in 2017. [WHO]_

The ICD 10 codes for measles are B05-B05.9, Z24.4,
and ICD 9 codes are 055-055.9, 484.0, V04.2, V73.2. [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_
