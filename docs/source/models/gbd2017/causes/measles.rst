Measles

Disease Information
===================

Measles is a highly contagious, serious disease caused by a virus.
Before the introduction of measles vaccine in 1963 and widespread vaccination,
major epidemics occurred approximately every 2–3 years and measles caused an
estimated 2.6 million deaths each year.

Approximately  110 000 people died from measles in 2017 – mostly children
under the age of 5 years, despite the availability of a safe and effective
vaccine.

Measles is caused by a virus in the paramyxovirus family and it is
normally passed through direct contact and through the air. The virus
infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body.
Measles is a human disease and is not known to occur in animals.

Accelerated immunization activities have had a major impact on
reducing measles deaths. During 2000– 2017, measles vaccination prevented
an estimated  21.1 million deaths. Global measles deaths have decreased
by  80% from an estimated  545 000 in 2000* to  110 000 in 2017. [WHO]_

Measles is a contagious infection caused by the measles virus.
Symptoms include cough, runny nose, fever, conjunctivitis, and red,

and ICD 9 codes are 055-055.9, 484.0, V04.2, V73.2. [GBD-2017-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1]_
