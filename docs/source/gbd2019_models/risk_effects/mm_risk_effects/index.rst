Multiple Myeloma Risk Factor Effects
====================================

   :local:

We will follow the same strategy for risk factor effects as in the
:ref:`Multiple Myeloma Phase 1 concept model
<2019_concept_model_vivarium_sanofi_multiple_myeloma>`. However, we will likely

.. todo::

 Fill in details, referring to the :ref:`Risk factor model <mm5.3.2>` and
 :ref:`Risk factor effects <mm5.3.2.2>` sections in the Phase 1 concept model.
