Hemoglobin Model Description in GBD 2019
----------------------------------------

The hemoglobin model in GBD 2019 serves as the underlying basis for both the anemia impairment model and iron deficiency risk factor model. The hemoglobin model output is an estimate of the year-, location-, age-, and sex-speciifc **continuous ensemble distribution of population hemoglobin concentration in grams per liter**.

The hemoglobin distribution is estimated from a variety of sources reported as either anemia prevalence and/or mean and standard deviation hemoglobin concentration; altitude adjustments were made when appropriate and possible, although no smoking adjustments were performed. For data sources that *only* included pregnant women, data were crosswalked to the general population using MR-BRT such that pregnant women were matched to non-pregnant women in the same age and location group and the ratios of their hemoglobin concentrations were assessed. The resulting adjustment factor was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86 - 0.98), such that the hemoglobin level of pregnant women is 0.92 times that of non-pregnant women.

The hemoglobin distribution was modeled in three steps:

1. ST-GPR models of mean and standard deviation hemoglobin concentration (including pregnancy adjustments as described above). 

    Covariates for the mean model included Age-specific Fertility Rate, HIV Prevalence, SEV for Child underweight, SEV for Child wasting, Malaria Incidence, Haemoglobin C (sickle type C) trait (all ages), Haemoglobin S (sickle type S) trait (all ages), Sociodemographic Index, SEV for Impaired kidney function, Healthcare Access and Quality index, Modern contraception prevalence, and 50th percentile of haemoglobin (pooled across all microdata sources). 

    Covariates for the standard deviation model included: Malaria Incidence, Haemoglobin C (sickle type C) trait, Haemoglobin S (sickle type S) trait, Sociodemographic Index, SEV for Impaired kidney function, Healthcare Access and Quality index, Education Relative Inequality (Gini), 50th percentile of haemoglobin (pooled across all microdata sources), and mean haemoglobin (results from mean [Hb] ST-GPR model)

2. Calculation of ensemble weights

    A set of two-parameter distributions (gamma, mirror gamma, Weibull, mirror lognormal, and mirror gumbel) were fit to the sampleâ€™s haemoglobin mean and variance for each location/year/age/sex group

    The weights used for the GBD 2019 hemoglobin distribution model were 40% gamma and 60% mirror gumbel.

3. Generation of ensemble distributions for each location/year/age/sex group

    Because anemia thresholds depend on pregnancy status, hemoglobin distributions were modeled separately for pregnant and non-pregnant females. The pregnancy model was identical to the non-pregnancy model except that the mean and variance were adjusted by the adjustment factor. The prevalence of anemia in pregnant women and non-pregnant women were then weighted by the pregnancy rate and combined to estimate population anemia prevalence. See the table below for the exact adjustment factors used.

      The pregnancy rate was represented as :math:`(ASFR + SB) * 46/52`, where :math:`ASFR` is the location- and age-specific fertility rate and :math:`SB` is the location-specific stillbirth rate.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

The Vivarium hemoglobin modeling strategy will be to sample values from the GBD 2019 year-, location-, age-, and sex-specific hemoglobin concentration distribution in order to assign specific hemoglobin concentration values to individual simulants. 

Restrictions
++++++++++++

There are no formal restrictions; however, the hemoglobin estimates are unreliable for the early and late neonatal age groups and should be used with caution. Additionally, the pregnancy adjustment will apply to women of reproductive age, so special attention should be paid when modelling this demographic group.

Below is R code written to randomly sample hemoglobin concentration values from the hemoglobin distribution parameters and constants defined in the tables above. Additionally, the code block contains functions that will evaluate the proportion of the distribution below a given threshold. This code was adapted from the GBD stash code found `here <https://stash.ihme.washington.edu/projects/MNCH/repos/anemia/browse/model/envelope>`_, specifically the *DistList_mv2p.R* and *fit_ensemblemv2p_parallel.R* files. 

.. note::

  Attempts to move this code to python have not been successful in validating to GBD while using the R code has been successful. The recommended approach is to use the python package `rpy2` to run this R code within python.

Pregnancy Adjustment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To sample hemoglobin values for pregnant/lactating women, use the same functions as above, but multiply the hemoglobin mean and standard deviation parameters used for those functions by the respective pregnancy adjustment factors listed below. Notably, the GBD 2019 assumes that the pregnancy adjustment factor applies to 40 weeks of gestation and 6 weeks post-gestation.

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

Hemoglobin samples should satisfy the following criteria:

- all_samples > 0
- all_samples < XMAX = 220
- mean(all_samples) ~= meid_10487
- sd(all_samples) ~= meid_10488

When the pregnancy adjustment is applied:

- mean(general_population_samples) > mean(pregnant_population_samples)
- standard_deviation(general_population_samples) < standard_deviation(pregnant_population_samples)

At the population distribution level:

- ens_mv2prev(upper_mild_threshold) ~= total anemia impairment prevalence
- ens_mv2prev(upper_mild_threshold) - ens_mv2prev(lower_mild_threshold) ~= mild anemia impairment prevalence
- ens_mv2prev(upper_moderate_threshold) - ens_mv2prev(lower_moderate_threshold) ~= moderate anemia impairment prevalence
- ens_mv2prev(upper_severe_threshold) - ens_mv2prev(lower_severe_threshold) ~= severe anemia impairment prevalence
