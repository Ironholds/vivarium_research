Disease Overview
----------------

*Also known as abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), thoracic aortic aneurysm* (*TAA*)

An aneurysm is a balloon-like bulge in an artery. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to your organs. Aortic aneurysms are aneurysms that occur in the aorta, the main artery carrying oxygen-rich blood to your body. The aorta has thick walls that withstand normal blood pressure. However, certain medical problems, genetic conditions, and trauma can damage or weaken these walls. The force of blood pushing against the weakened or injured walls can cause an aneurysm. 
 
An aortic aneurysm can grow large and either rupture or split. A split is called a dissection and, like a rupture, is life-threatening. Early diagnosis and treatment may prevent serious or life-threatening complications. However, aortic aneurysms can develop and grow large before causing any symptoms. Doctors may be able to slow the growth of an aortic aneurysm with medicines or repair it with surgery if it is found before it ruptures or dissects.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

GBD 2019 Non-Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Aortic aneurysm is not currently modeled as a non-fatal model in GBD.

GBD 2019 Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We included vital registration data in a standard CODEm approach to model aortic aneurysm.

Restrictions
++++++++++++

The following table describes any restrictions in GBD 2019 on the effects of
this cause (such as being only fatal or only nonfatal), as well as restrictions
on the ages and sexes to which the cause applies.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

Aortic aneurysm is only a fatal condition and has no GBD nonfatal model. Initial approach is to allow deaths to occur per the standard simulation approach for any GBD cause. The cause-specific mortality rate should be modified by tobacco smoking; this relationship is defined in the overall concept model document. 

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Aortic aneurysm can be diagnosed via ultrasound and treated with either medication or surgery, which reduces the risk of mortality. However, as of GBD 2019, we do not estimate nonfatal burden for this cause.
