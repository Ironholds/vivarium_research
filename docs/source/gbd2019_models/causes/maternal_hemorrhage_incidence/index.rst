Disease Overview
----------------

Maternal hemorrhage is defined as bleeding during pregnancy (antenatal hemorrhage), during birth (peripartum hemorrhage), or postpartum (postpartum hemorrhage). The threshold of maternal hemorrhage is often defined by at least 500 mL of blood lost or 1 liter of blood lost in the case of a cesarean section. Severe hemorrhage is often categorized as 1 liter of blood lost in non-cesarean section cases. Postpartum hemorrhage comprises the majority of maternal hemorrhage cases.

Maternal hemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality worldwide. Major risk factors for maternal hemorrhage include maternal anemia and delivery in a non-facility setting. Interventions for the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage include the active management of the third stage of labor: a series of preventative steps that include the use of prophylactic uterotonic drugs (such as oxytocin), uterine massage, etc.

Measurement of the burden of maternal hemorrhage can be difficult due to the difficulty in estimating the amount of blood lost.

Maternal hemorrhage can result in adverse outcomes including anemia, blood transfusion, hysterectomy, and death.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Covariates for the estimation of the maternal hemorrhage fatal model include:

- In-facility delivery (proportion)
- Skilled birth attendance (proportion)
- Age- and sex-specific SEV for unsafe sanitation
- Neonatal mortality ratio (log-transformed)
- Maternal education
- Healthcare access and quality index

Anemia due to maternal hemorrhage is estimated as part of the :ref:`GBD 2019 anemia impairment and causal attribution process <2019_anemia_impairment>`.

State and Transition Data Tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section gives necessary information to software engineers for building the model. 
This section usually contains four tables: Definitions, State Data, Transition Data and Data Sources.

Definitions
"""""""""""

This table contains the definitions of all the states in **cause model diagram**. 

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 5 5 20
   :header-rows: 1

For example, the *Definitions* table for *SIR* and *With-Condition and Free of Condition Model* models are as below:

**SIR Model**

   :header-rows: 1

   * - I
     - Infected
     - Infected with {cause name}
   * - R
     - Recovered
     - Infected with {cause name}


**With-Condition and Free of Condition Model**

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 1, 5, 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name

     - With **C**\ ondition
     - Born with {cause name}
   * - F
     - **F**\ ree of Condition
     - Born without {cause name}

Include states, their names and definitions appropriate to your model.

States Data
"""""""""""

This table contains the **measures** and their **values** for each state in cause-model diagram. This information is used to 
initialize the model. The common measures in each state are prevalence, birth prevalence, excess mortality rate and disability weights. 
Cause specific mortality rate is the common measure for all states. In most of the models either prevalence or birth prevalence is used. 
But in some rare cases like neonatal models both prevalence and birth prevalence are used in model initialization. The Value column contains the formula to calculate 
the measure in each state.

The structure of the table is as below. For each state, the measures and values must be included.

Transition Data
"""""""""""""""

This table contains the measures needed for transition from one state to other in the cause model. The common measures used are *incident rate* to 
move from Susceptible to Infected and *remission rate* to move from Infected to Susceptible or Recovered states. Some times there may not be transition 
between states as in Neonatal disorders.

The structure of the table is as below.
