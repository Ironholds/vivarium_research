Disease Overview
----------------

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell neoplasm with substantial morbidity and mortality, characterized by end organ damageâ€”renal 
impairment, hypercalcemia, lytic bony lesions, and anemia. 

According to GBD 2019, there were 27 thousand incident cases (95% UI 23-33), 18 thousand deaths (95% UI 16-21), and 350 thousand (95% UI 326-431) disability adjusted life years (DALYs) due to multiple myeloma in the US in 2019.

From 2010 to 2019, MM incident cases increased by 25%, and deaths increased by 27% for both sexes in the US.

With the development of better therapies, myeloma has changed from an untreatable ailment to one that is still not curable but treatable with mostly outpatient therapy. 
Although several new treatment options for multiple myeloma are now available, there is no cure for this disease. And almost all patient with multiple myeloma develop relapse/refractory.
Relapse is an inevitable feature of multiple myeloma, resulting in a continued need for new active treatments. Relapse is the return of a cancer, multiple myeloma here, after a clinically disease-free interval. The term relapse is usually used to describe the return of a leukemia, lymphoma, or other hematopoietic malignancy, rather than the return of a carcinoma, according to National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program [SEER]_. 

Refractory multiple myeloma is multiple myeloma that is not responsive to usual therapies. Patients are considered to have relapsed/ refractory multiple myeloma if they have achieved a minor response or better to treatment relapse and then progress on salvage therapy, or experience progression within 60 days of their last therapy.

The combination of pomalidomide and low-dose dexamethasone is an approved and established option for the treatment of relapsed and refractory myeloma in
patients who have received at least two previous therapies. A randomised, multicentre, open-label, phase 3 study [Attal-et-al-2019-mm]_
was taken to compare isatuximab plus pomalidomide and dexamethasone with pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. Result shows that the addition of isatuximab to pomalidomide and dexamethasone was associated with a significant and
clinically meaningful benefit in progression-free survival in heavily treated patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with results from both the investigators
and an independent response committee being consistent.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Multiple Myeloma in GBD 2019
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In GBD 2019, MM includes death and disability resulting from malignant neoplasms of plasma cells, including ICD-10 codes such as C90.0. The GBD modeling strategy can be found in the GBD YLD Capstone Appendix [GBD-2019-YLD-Capstone-Appendix-1-Neoplasms]_.

There is nothing custom about how MM is modeled in GBD compared to the other cancer causes that go through our standard fatal and non-fatal modeling pipelines.

Cause Model Diagram
+++++++++++++++++++

.. image:: cause_model_diagram.svg

Overview
++++++++

To study the impact of different lines of treament for myeloma patients, we
split multiple myeloma into two disease states: newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM);
and relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). The RRMM state consists of
multiple relapse stages. This MM cause model is intended to simulate MM incidence,
relapse, and mortality. The inputs for this cause model come from GBD 2019 estimates,
scientific literature, and survival analysis supported by Flatiron data.

In our model, treatment and relapse perfectly correspond; that is,
a simulant in the NDMM state is receiving Line 1 treatment, a simulant in the MM_first_relapse state
is receiving Line 2 treatment, etc. New treatment assignment is therefore performed only at the time of
relapse.

Notably, the OS and TTD survival analyses supported by Flatiron data provide
data on death *from any cause* among multiple myeloma patients and
not death due to multiple myeloma specifically.
Therefore, the excess mortality defined in this document will be the only source
of mortality among simulants with multiple myeloma and excess mortality among
simulants with multiple myeloma for "other causes," as typically defined by the
cause-deleted all-cause mortality rate, should be zero.

Multiple Myeloma Mortality Details
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

As previously mentioned, the excess mortality rates defined in the tables above
represent *all-cause* mortality rates among patients 
with multiple myeloma. For simplicity, in our simulation, deaths that occur among 
simulants in any of the multiple myeloma cause model states other than susceptible
should be recorded as deaths due to multiple myeloma. While deaths due to other
causes are typically modeled in Vivarium cause models among simulants with a given
cause, simulants in multiple myeloma cause model states other than the susceptible 
state should have zero probability of death due to other causes. Simulants without
multiple myeloma (in the susceptible cause model state) should die due to causes
other than multiple myeloma ("other causes") at a rate equal to the multiple
myeloma-deleted all cause mortality rate. Details are shown in the table below.

.. list-table:: MM State-Specific Mortality Hazard Rates and Causes of Death
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Cause model state

     - Probability of death due to multiple myeloma
     - Probability of death due to other causes

     - 0
     - 1
   * - All MM states
     - state-specific EMR from state table data

     - 0

Notably, the multiple myeloma mortality rate used to model excess mortality among simulants with multiple myeloma is informed by Flatiron data and the multiple myeloma mortality rate to inform the multiple myeloma-deleted all cause mortality rate among simulants without multiple myeloma is informed by GBD. Mortality rates informed by Flatiron and GBD should be similar in order to accurately model all-cause mortality rates in our simulation; this should be evaluated in model verification and validation.

Estimate MM Prevalence by Disease Stage
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We used a â€˜burn-inâ€™ approach to estimate the prevalence of NDMM and the
prevalence of RRMM in a manner consistent with the incidence rates estimated
from GBD and the survival rates reported in Braunlin et al. To do this, we
started the simulation in 2011, 10 years prior to the start date of interest.
At this time point, a proportion of simulants equal to the age- and sex-specific
MM prevalence from GBD 2019 were initialized into the NDMM disease state;
no simulants were initialized into the RRMM disease state(s). We then let the
simulation run from 2011 to 2021 using our transition and mortality rates and
updated the distribution of MM prevalence by disease states (NDMM, RRMM in first
relapse, RRMM in second relapse, etc.) accordingly.

Calculation of Mortality and Relapse Hazard
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Hazards were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models fit to Flatiron data. These
models allow the hazard to vary over time since treatment line initiation, and assume a linear effect of line number (each relapse
increases hazard by the same multiplier). They do not include any other covariates.

In the model for relapse hazard in first through fourth lines (TTNT), the event is initiation of a new line of treatment. Patients are censored at
the point that our line-of-therapy coding algorithm can no longer code their EHR data.

In the model for mortality hazard in first through fourth lines (TTD), the event is death. Patients are censored at initiation of a new line of treatment,
and also at the point that our line-of-therapy coding algorithm can no longer code their EHR data, except when this point
precedes death by less than 60 days.

The model for mortality hazard in the fifth line (OS) is like the previous lines, except that patients are not censored at initiation of a new treatment, only
at loss to follow-up, defined as their last visit, if they do not have a death record. Patients with a death record are never censored.

Line-specific predictions were made with models trained on 1,000 bootstrap resamples of the dataset to generate 1,000 draws of these predictions.

To extrapolate these hazards into longer follow-up than is present in the source data, predictions are only used until the time since treatment line initiation of the fifth-to-last
event in the data. After that point, the average hazard up to that point is continued as a constant hazard into the future.

Model Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

#. This cause model assumes no recovery from MM and RRMM since myeloma is an
   incurable disease. Patients with MM will inevitably develop relapse and the
   health outcomes worsen with every relapse and line of treatment.
#. This cause model assumes that relapse and new treatment lines always correspond and
   occur simultaneously.
#. This cause model assumes that the GBD incidence rate corresponds to the incidence
   of symptomatic MM. That said, we are comfortable using GBD incidence of MM
   as the detection rate of symptomatic MM cases. The incidence of RRMM will be
   calculated from survival regression analysis based on Flatiron data.
#. The asymptomatic/idolent state (smoldering MM) is excluded from this cause
   model because we are not interested in the screening and early management for
   MM. As a result, the simulation will not track/model simulants with asymptomatic
   condition.
#. YLLs are substantially larger than YLDs for this cause. For now, we will not
   build a disability component to capture those secondary outcomes.
#. The most advanced disease state in this cause model is
   fourth or higher relapse of RRMM. We track deaths from simulants
   who have developed fourth relapse/received fifth-line treatment but do not specifically
   track the number of relapses a simulant has had beyond four. We assume that risk factor and
   treatment effects on mortality apply to both TTD (in other states) and OS (in this state).
   We ignore risk factor and treatment effects on relapse after the fourth relapse.
#. The effect of line number/number of relapses on both relapse and mortality is not adjusted
   for risk factor and treatment effects.
#. We assume that hazards increase by a constant hazard ratio with each additional relapse.

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

 - Model 1 (Susceptible to MM): compare simulation baseline results of MM prevalence, 
   MM incidence, and MM cause-specific mortality stratified by age, sex, and year to 
   GBD 2019 age-/sex-specific MM estimates.
 - Model 2 (MM to MM_{Nth}_relapse): compare simulation baseline results of overall 
   survival and progression-free survival by disease state to line-specific survival 
   outcomes obtained from [Braunlin-et-al-2020]_.
