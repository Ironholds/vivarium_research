Disease Overview
----------------
Patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) have decreased lower extremity arterial perfusion which is commonly referred to as “poor circulation.” In most cases of PAD, atherosclerotic plaques narrow the arterial flow lumen which restricts blood flow to the distal extremity. Reduced blood flow can cause thigh or calf pain with walking due to temporary ischemia of the leg muscles during exertion. Walking pain from PAD is referred to as intermittent claudication which means “to limp.” Many patients with PAD have either no symptoms or atypical complaints that do not strictly conform to the definition of claudication. Others may develop limb-threatening compromise of blood flow, necessitating emergent surgery. PAD acts as a marker for systemic atherosclerosis. PAD usually involves atherosclerotic disease in the abdominal aorta, iliac, and femoral arteries. The pathophysiology of atherosclerosis involves complex interactions between cholesterol and vascular cells the details. Atherosclerotic plaque builds up slowly on the inside of arteries. In the early stages of PAD, the arteries compensate for the plaque buildup by dilating to preserve flow through the vessel. Eventually, the artery cannot dilate any further, and the atherosclerotic plaque starts to narrow the arterial flow lumen.

State and Transition Data Tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This section gives necessary information to software engineers for building the model. 
This section usually contains four tables: Definitions, State Data, Transition Data and Data Sources.

Definitions
"""""""""""

This table contains the definitions of all the states in **cause model diagram**. 

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 5 5 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name
     - Definition
   * - 
     - 
     - 
   * - 
     - 
     - 

For example, the *Definitions* table for *SIR* and *With-Condition and Free of Condition Model* models are as below:

**SIR Model**

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 5 5 20
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name
     - Definition
   * - S
     - Susceptible
     - Susceptible to {cause name}
   * - I
     - Infected
     - Infected with {cause name}
   * - R
     - Recovered
     - Infected with {cause name}


**With-Condition and Free of Condition Model**

.. list-table:: State Definitions
   :widths: 1, 5, 10
   :header-rows: 1

   * - State
     - State Name
     - Definition
   * - C
     - With **C**\ ondition
     - Born with {cause name}
   * - F
     - **F**\ ree of Condition
     - Born without {cause name}

Include states, their names and definitions appropriate to your model.

States Data
"""""""""""

This table contains the **measures** and their **values** for each state in cause-model diagram. This information is used to 
initialize the model. The common measures in each state are prevalence, birth prevalence, excess mortality rate and disability weights. 
Cause specific mortality rate is the common measure for all states. In most of the models either prevalence or birth prevalence is used. 
But in some rare cases like neonatal models both prevalence and birth prevalence are used in model initialization. The Value column contains the formula to calculate 
the measure in each state.

The structure of the table is as below. For each state, the measures and values must be included.

.. list-table:: States Data
   :widths: 20 25 30 30

   * - ALL
     - cause specific mortality rate
     - :math:`\frac{\text{deaths_cid}}{\text{population}}`
     - 

Transition Data
"""""""""""""""

This table contains the measures needed for transition from one state to other in the cause model. The common measures used are *incident rate* to 
move from Susceptible to Infected and *remission rate* to move from Infected to Susceptible or Recovered states. Some times there may not be transition 
between states as in Neonatal disorders.

The structure of the table is as below. 

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition

     - 
   * - r

An example, if the data is present in GBD,

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition

     - 
   * - r
     - I
     - R
     - remission_rate_cid
     - 

Sometimes, we might need to use *modelable entity id* to get data. Sometimes, we might need to calculate remission rate 
based on average case duration. In that case, the row would look like,

.. list-table:: Transition Data
   :widths: 10 10 10 20 30
   :header-rows: 1
   
   * - Transition

   * - r
     - I
     - R
     - remission_rate_cid :math:`= \frac{\text{365 person-days}}{\text{average case duration in days} \times \text{1 year}}`
     - 
	 

Data Sources

This table contains the data sources for all the measures. The table structure and common measures are as below:
