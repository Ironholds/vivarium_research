Disease Description
-------------------

Diarrhea is commonly defined as three or more loose stools in a 24-hour 
period. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix]_

Diarrhea has various etiologies, with infectious diarrhea accounting for the 
vast majority of global diarrheal disease burden. The top pathogens responsible 
for diarrhea include norovirus, rotavirus, E. Coli, Camplyobacter, and 
Salmonella. Bacterial infections, and specifically species of Shigella, 
account for the majority of bloody diarrhea.

Infection most commonly occurs via feces-contamined water, and can also spread 
via contamined food and person-to-person contact. ([WHO]_)

The global prevalence of diarrhea thus varies considerably accoring to resource 
access. In particular, resource-limited countries have a "baseline frequency... 
superimposed with epidemic cases of diarrhea" ([UpToDate_1]_). The top risk 
factors for diarrheal diseases thus include crowding (such as living in refugee 
camps) and poor sanitation, in addition to immune system-compromising conditions, 
such as living with HIV.

The most significant outcomes of a nonfatal diarrhea episode are dehydration and 
the loss of nutrition. In particular, in low-income countries, the high 
prevalence of diarrhea is a major cause of child malnutrition ([WHO]_), which 
in turn makes such children more susceptible to future diarrheal episodes and 
other negative sequelae.

The WHO-recommended measures for diarrhea prevention include:
	- Access to safe drinking water;
	- Use of improved sanitation;
	- Hand washing with soap;
	- Exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life;
	- Good personal and food hygiene;
	- Health education about how infections spread; and
	- Rotavirus vaccination.

Noninfectious diarrhea etiologies are far less common, but are more likely among 
chronic cases of diarrhea. Causes of noninfectious diarrhea include ischemic 
colitis, inflammatory bowl disease, among others ([UpToDate_2]_).
