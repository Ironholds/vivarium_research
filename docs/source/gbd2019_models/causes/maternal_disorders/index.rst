Disease Overview
----------------

Maternal mortality related to obsetrics is a relatively rare but consequential outcome. Maternal morbidity related to obsetrics may be longlasting and significant. There are several factors that are associated with risk of obstetric mortality and morbidity, mainly related to access to health care. Proper antenatal care services and in-facility delivery are associated with lower maternal disorder burden. Additionally, factors such as maternal age and BMI are additional parameters that may be associated with maternal disorder burden.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

In GBD, deaths due to maternal disorders (maternal deaths) comprise all deaths due to obstetric complications (direct maternal deaths) or concurrent disorders exacerbated by pregnancy (indirect maternal deaths) up to one year after the end of the pregnancy, irrespective of the method by which pregnancy ended and excluding accidental and incidental deaths. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_, page 184.

Maternal disorders nonfatal estimation includes disability due to seven of ten maternal subcauses,
including 1) Abortion and miscarriage; 2) Ectopic pregnancy; 3) Obstructed labour and uterine rupture;
4) Maternal haemorrhage; 5) Maternal sepsis and other maternal infections; 6) Maternal hypertensive
disorders; and 7) Other [direct] maternal disorders. Indirect maternal disorders, late maternal deaths,
and maternal deaths aggravated by HIV/AIDS did not have any estimated disability based on the premise
that it is captured in the respective underlying causes. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_ page 744.

YLDs were estimated for other [direct] maternal disorders YLD-to-YLL ratio approach where the ratio of
YLD:YLL were pooled for all the causes in the list above and multiplied by the YLL for other [direct]
maternal disorders. For other subcauses of maternal disorders, including late maternal death, indirect
maternal disorders, and maternal death complicated by HIV/AIDS, we did not estimate any nonfatal
burden based on the premise that the associated disability is captured in the respective causes. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_ page 745.

Subcause definitions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Abortion** is defined as elective or medically-indicated termination of pregnancy at any gestational age and **miscarriage** is defined as spontaneous loss of pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation with complications requiring medical care.
- **Ectopic pregnancy** is defined as any pregnancy occurring outside of the uterus.
- **Obstructed labour and uterine rupture**

  - Acute event includes failure to progress (no advance of the presenting part of the fetus despite strong uterine contractions), cephalopelvic disproportion (foetal size that is too large for maternal pelvic dimensions), non-vertex foetal positioning during labour (any foetal position besides head down during labour; excludes non-vertex positioning during antepartum period), and uterine rupture during labour (non-surgical breakdown of uterine wall during labour and delivery). Perineal lacerations without any of the above conditions are excluded from the case definition.

  - Fistula is defined as an abnormal connection between either vagina and large intestine (rectovaginal fistula) or between vagina bladder (vesicovaginal fistula). Fistula YLDs are included in YLDs for obstructed labour; estimation is described in a separate appendix section on “Fistula – impairment.”

- **Maternal haemorrhage** (including placental disorders) – includes both postpartum (>500 ml for vaginal delivery and >1,000 ml for cesarean delivery) and antepartum haemorrhage vaginal bleeding from any cause at or beyond 20 weeks of gestation and prior to onset of labour). This also includes placental disorders with haemorrhage regardless of blood volume lost or timing of bleeding event. Placental disorders without haemorrhage are included with other [direct] maternal disorders.

- **Maternal sepsis** and other maternal infections:

    - Maternal sepsis is defined as a temperature <36°C or >38°C and clinical signs of shock including systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and tachycardia >120 bpm 

    - Other maternal infections are defined as any maternal infections excluding HIV, sexually transmitted infections, or are not believed to have epidemiologic relationship with pregnancy. Examples include urinary tract infections, mastitis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.

- **Hypertensive disorders** of pregnancy – overall category defined as having blood pressure (BP) >140/90 based on multiple measurements in persons who were not hypertensive prior to pregnancy.

- **Other [direct] maternal disorders** include a variety of different obstetric complications. The most common of these in ICD-10 coded vital registration sources in terms of number of deaths include O88 (obstetric embolism), O26 (Maternal care for other conditions predominantly related to pregnancy), O90 (Complications of the puerperium, not elsewhere classified), O75 (Other complications of labor and delivery, not elsewhere classified), C58 (Malignant neoplasm of placenta), and O36 (Maternal care for other fetal problems).

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

We will convert the maternal disorders deaths and disability as estimated by GBD in terms of an annual rate among women of reproductive age to events *per birth* (including stillbirths) for use in our :ref:`simulation of IV iron <2019_concept_model_vivarium_iv_iron>`. Births among women of reproductive age in our simulation will be informed by the :ref:`pregnancy model document <other_models_pregnancy>`.

Scope
+++++

We will model maternal disorders a single cause related to birth as informed through the :ref:`pregnancy model document <other_models_pregnancy>`. This model will not distinguish between morbidity and mortality related to specific subcauses or sequelae of maternal disorders. This cause model will be affected by the :ref:`iron deficiency risk factor <2019_risk_effect_iron_deficiency>`, which is assumed to affect maternal disorders mortality and morbidity equally.

We will not model maternal disorders as a dynamic transition model, but rather as discrete events that occur at birth. The probability of maternal disorder deaths will be informed by a maternal mortality ratio derived from GBD data; YLLs will be measured based on the mother's age at birth. The rate of YLDs due to maternal disorders will be based on a ratio of incident maternal disorders per birth and assigned the annual value of YLDs per incidence maternal disorder case.

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- We assume that all maternal disorders deaths occur at birth. For deaths due to late maternal disorders, this will result in earlier maternal deaths in our model than in reality, which may overestimate the impact of maternal mortality on infant outcomes such as breastfeeding behaviors/orphanhood when we model maternal-child dyads. We may overestimate YLLs due to late maternal deaths and underestimate YLLs due to abortions, miscarriages, and ectopic pregnancies.

- We assume that all maternal disorders morbidity *begins* at birth and persists for one year after birth. For morbidity due to hypertensive disorders and maternal sepsis may occur prior to when we model it. For sequelae that persist for longer than one year (ex: long term sequelae of eclampsia, infertility, fistula), we will underestimate YLDs.

- We will assume that mothers experience mortality due to maternal disorders also experience associated morbidity. This may not be a logical assumption for subcauses with long term sequelae, including maternal hemorrhage, maternal hypertensive disorders, and obstructed labor and uterine rupture; however, it is likely a logical assumption for other maternal disorders subcauses including maternal sepsis, abortion and miscarriage, and acute sequelae of the other maternal disorder subcauses.

- Our strategy of subtracting anemia sequelae YLDs from maternal disorders YLDs assumes no comorbidity status between anemia due to maternal hemorrhage and other sequelae of maternal disorders. This assumption will result in an underestimation of maternal disorder YLDs other than anemia due to maternal hemorrhage.

- We are limited in that abortions, miscarriages, and ectopic pregnancies that occur prior to 24 weeks gestation are not included in our model of pregnancy and we therefore may overestimate the rate at which they occur among pregnant women in our simulation.

  Consider adding the incident rate of these outcomes to the pregnancy model.

Data Tables
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Ratios of maternal disorder mortality and incidence are defined in the table below. These values should represent the probability that a simulant experiences a death or incident case of maternal disorders at birth in our simulation. This cause model should be implemented such that each simulant who experiences deaths due to maternal disorders also experiences an incident case of maternal disorders.

Years of life lost
"""""""""""""""""""

Years of life lost (YLLs) should be assigned to simulants who experience a death due to maternal disorders based on their age and theoretical minimum risk life expectancy at the time of death.

Years lived with disability
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Years lived with disability (YLDs) should be assigned to simulants who experience an incident case of maternal disorders. Rather than accumulate YLDs according to time spent in a particular cause model state and the disability weight associated with that state (as done for standard cause models), we will assign YLDs to an individual simulant all at once according to the average amount of YLDs exerpienced in a single maternal disorder incident case.

For simulations that evaluate disability due to anemia through the :ref:`hemoglobin/anemia model <2019_hemoglobin_anemia_and_iron_deficiency>` such as the :ref:`IV iron simulation <2019_concept_model_vivarium_iv_iron>`, the disability due to anemia sequelae should not be counted as part of YLDs due to maternal disorders as they will be tracked separately as YLDs due to anemia.

Therefore, the value of YLDs to assign to a simulant who experienced an incident case of maternal disorders is as follows:

.. math::

  (\text{ylds}_{c366} - \text{ylds}_\text{s182,s183,s184}) / \text{incidence_rate}_{c366}

.. note::

  Implementation of YLDs due to maternal disorders should ensure that the sum of YLDs across maternal disorder YLDs and YLDs due to other simultaneous prevalent causes that a simulant may be afflicted with (such as anemia or postpartum depression), reflects the strategy of calculating joint disability weights of multiple comorbid conditions as shown in the equation below:

  .. math::

    DW_\text{overall} = 1 - \prod_{n=1}^{n} 1 - DW_n

  A potential stratgey is to calculate a maternal disorders disability weight equal to :math:`\frac{(\text{ylds}_{c366} - \text{ylds}_\text{s182,s183,s184}) / \text{incidence_rate}_{c366}}{365}` and creating a cause model state of maternal disorder disability that a simulant occupies for one year. Notably, this strategy assumes that no simulants in this state will die in the year following birth and may result in a slight underestimation of YLDs due to maternal disorders.

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

- The maternal disorders incidence, mortality, YLL, and YLD rate per person-year among women of reproductive age in the simulation should validate to estimates from GBD (the simulation may slightly underestimate YLDs due to the removal of anemia sequlae from maternal disorder YLDs as they are counted separately).
- Maternal disorders deaths and incidence should occur among pregnant women only
