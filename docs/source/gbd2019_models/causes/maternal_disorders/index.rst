Disease Overview
----------------

Maternal mortality related to obsetrics is a relatively rare but consequential outcome. Maternal morbidity related to obsetrics may be longlasting and significant. There are several factors that are associated with risk of obstetric mortality and morbidity, mainly related to access to health care. Proper antenatal care services and in-facility delivery are associated with lower maternal disorder burden. Additionally, factors such as maternal age and BMI are additional parameters that may be associated with maternal disorder burden.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

In GBD, deaths due to maternal disorders (maternal deaths) comprise all deaths due to obstetric complications (direct maternal deaths) or concurrent disorders exacerbated by pregnancy (indirect maternal deaths) up to one year after the end of the pregnancy, irrespective of the method by which pregnancy ended and excluding accidental and incidental deaths. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_, page 184.

Maternal disorders nonfatal estimation includes disability due to seven of ten maternal subcauses,
including 1) Abortion and miscarriage; 2) Ectopic pregnancy; 3) Obstructed labour and uterine rupture;
4) Maternal haemorrhage; 5) Maternal sepsis and other maternal infections; 6) Maternal hypertensive
disorders; and 7) Other [direct] maternal disorders. Indirect maternal disorders, late maternal deaths,
and maternal deaths aggravated by HIV/AIDS did not have any estimated disability based on the premise
that it is captured in the respective underlying causes. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_ page 744.

YLDs were estimated for other [direct] maternal disorders YLD-to-YLL ratio approach where the ratio of
YLD:YLL were pooled for all the causes in the list above and multiplied by the YLL for other [direct]
maternal disorders. For other subcauses of maternal disorders, including late maternal death, indirect
maternal disorders, and maternal death complicated by HIV/AIDS, we did not estimate any nonfatal
burden based on the premise that the associated disability is captured in the respective causes. [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-Maternal-Disorders]_ page 745.

Subcause definitions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

- **Abortion** is defined as elective or medically-indicated termination of pregnancy at any gestational age and **miscarriage** is defined as spontaneous loss of pregnancy before 24 weeks of gestation with complications requiring medical care.
- **Ectopic pregnancy** is defined as any pregnancy occurring outside of the uterus.
- **Obstructed labour and uterine rupture**

  - Acute event includes failure to progress (no advance of the presenting part of the fetus despite strong uterine contractions), cephalopelvic disproportion (foetal size that is too large for maternal pelvic dimensions), non-vertex foetal positioning during labour (any foetal position besides head down during labour; excludes non-vertex positioning during antepartum period), and uterine rupture during labour (non-surgical breakdown of uterine wall during labour and delivery). Perineal lacerations without any of the above conditions are excluded from the case definition.

  - Fistula is defined as an abnormal connection between either vagina and large intestine (rectovaginal fistula) or between vagina bladder (vesicovaginal fistula). Fistula YLDs are included in YLDs for obstructed labour; estimation is described in a separate appendix section on “Fistula – impairment.”

- **Maternal haemorrhage** (including placental disorders) – includes both postpartum (>500 ml for vaginal delivery and >1,000 ml for cesarean delivery) and antepartum haemorrhage vaginal bleeding from any cause at or beyond 20 weeks of gestation and prior to onset of labour). This also includes placental disorders with haemorrhage regardless of blood volume lost or timing of bleeding event. Placental disorders without haemorrhage are included with other [direct] maternal disorders.

- **Maternal sepsis** and other maternal infections:

    - Maternal sepsis is defined as a temperature <36°C or >38°C and clinical signs of shock including systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg and tachycardia >120 bpm 

    - Other maternal infections are defined as any maternal infections excluding HIV, sexually transmitted infections, or are not believed to have epidemiologic relationship with pregnancy. Examples include urinary tract infections, mastitis, candidiasis, and bacterial vaginosis during pregnancy.

- **Hypertensive disorders** of pregnancy – overall category defined as having blood pressure (BP) >140/90 based on multiple measurements in persons who were not hypertensive prior to pregnancy.

- **Other [direct] maternal disorders** include a variety of different obstetric complications. The most common of these in ICD-10 coded vital registration sources in terms of number of deaths include O88 (obstetric embolism), O26 (Maternal care for other conditions predominantly related to pregnancy), O90 (Complications of the puerperium, not elsewhere classified), O75 (Other complications of labor and delivery, not elsewhere classified), C58 (Malignant neoplasm of placenta), and O36 (Maternal care for other fetal problems).

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

We will convert the maternal disorders deaths and disability as estimated by GBD in terms of an annual rate among women of reproductive age to events *per birth* (including stillbirths) for use in our :ref:`simulation of IV iron <2019_concept_model_vivarium_iv_iron>`. Births among women of reproductive age in our simulation will be informed by the the :ref:`pregnancy model document <other_models_pregnancy>`.

We will need to pay particular attention to our strategy and assumptions regarding:

- Abortion and miscarriage and ectopic pregnancies (which are not included in our estimation of pregnancy since they are not defined as stillbirths)
- Late maternal deaths (for which modeling death at birth may not be appropriate)
- Disability associated with conditions that persist for greater than one year

State and Transition Data Tables

This section gives necessary information to software engineers for building the model. 
This section usually contains four tables: Definitions, State Data, Transition Data and Data Sources.

Definitions

This table contains the definitions of all the states in **cause model diagram**.

     - Born without {cause name}

Include states, their names and definitions appropriate to your model.

States Data
"""""""""""

This table contains the **measures** and their **values** for each state in cause-model diagram. This information is used to 
initialize the model. The common measures in each state are prevalence, birth prevalence, excess mortality rate and disability weights. 
Cause specific mortality rate is the common measure for all states. In most of the models either prevalence or birth prevalence is used. 
But in some rare cases like neonatal models both prevalence and birth prevalence are used in model initialization. The Value column contains the formula to calculate 
the measure in each state.

The structure of the table is as below. For each state, the measures and values must be included.

Transition Data
"""""""""""""""

This table contains the measures needed for transition from one state to other in the cause model. The common measures used are *incident rate* to 
move from Susceptible to Infected and *remission rate* to move from Infected to Susceptible or Recovered states. Some times there may not be transition 
between states as in Neonatal disorders.

The structure of the table is as below.
