Ischemic Heart Disease and Heart Failure
========================================

In the GBD, IHD and heart failure are separated. IHD is a cause and heart failure is 
considered an impairment, without deaths directly attributed to it. For this project, 
we are modeling HF in two parts: due to ischemic heart disease and residual, both of which are 
represented on this page.

Disease Overview
----------------

**Ischemic Heart Disease** 

Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is a non-communicable cardiovascular disease which occurs when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. IHD is also referred to as coronary artery disease or coronary heart disease and is often caused by the buildup of plaque, a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. This buildup can partially or totally block blood flow in the large arteries of the heart. Some types of this condition may be caused by disease or injury affecting how the arteries work in the heart.

Symptoms of coronary heart disease may be different from person to person even if they have the same type of coronary heart disease. Acute coronary events may cause symptoms such as angina, cold sweats, dizziness, nausea, neck pain, shortness of breath, sleep disturbances, or weakness. Chronic ischemic heart disease can cause signs and symptoms such as angina, anxiety or nervousness, fatigue, or neck pain. Symptoms may get worse as the buildup of plaque continues to narrow the coronary arteries. However, because many people have no symptoms, they do not know they have coronary heart disease until they have chest pain, a heart attack, or sudden cardiac arrest. 

Coronary microvascular disease is another type of coronary heart disease. It occurs when the heart’s tiny blood vessels do not work normally.

**Heart Failure** 

Heart failure is a condition in which the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In some cases, the heart can't fill with enough blood, while in others, the heart can't pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems. 

Heart failure develops over time as the heart's pumping action grows weaker. It can affect one or both sides of your heart. Right-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen. Left-side heart failure occurs if the heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body. Left-sided and right-sided heart failure may have different causes. Right-side heart failure may cause fluid to build up in the feet, ankles, legs, liver, abdomen, and the veins in the neck. Right-side and left-side heart failure also may cause shortness of breath and fatigue (tiredness). 

The leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart. Examples include ischemic heart disease, high blood pressure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

GBD 2019 Non-Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Case definitions:**\

1. Acute myocardial infarction (MI): Definite and possible MI according to the fourth universal definition of myocardial infarction:
  
  a. When there is clinical evidence of myocardial necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with myocardial ischaemia or
  b. Detection of a rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values and with at least one of the following: i) symptoms of ischaemia, ii) new or presumed new ST-segment-T wave changes or new left bundle branch block, iii) development of pathological Q waves in the ECG, iv) imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion abnormality, or v) identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography or autopsy.
  c. Sudden (abrupt) unexplained cardiac death, involving cardiac arrest or no evidence of a non-coronary cause of death
  d. Prevalent MI is considered to last from the onset of the event to 28 days after the event and is divided into an acute phase (0-2 days) and subacute (3-28 days).

2. Chronic IHD:
  
  a. Asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease following myocardial infarction; survival to 28 days following incident MI. The GBD study does not use estimates based on ECG evidence for prior MI, due to its limited specificity and sensitivity.
  b. Heart failure due to ischemic heart disease; The GBD case definition for heart failure impairment data sources includes studies in which heart failure was diagnosed clinically using structured criteria such as the Framingham or European Society of Cardiology criteria. Beginning in GBD 2016, we used ACC/AHA Stage C and above to capture both persons who are currently symptomatic and those who have been diagnosed with heart failure but are currently asymptomatic. 

[Framingham]_
[Cardiology]_

3. Heart Failure: 
Heart failure was diagnosed clinically using structured criteria such as the Framingham or European Society of Cardiology criteria. Previous iterations of GBD modelled symptomatic (i.e., NYHA Class II and above) episodes of HF only. Beginning in GBD 2016, we used ACC/AHA Stage C and above to capture both persons who are currently symptomatic and those who have been diagnosed with heart failure but are currently asymptomatic. 

Framingham Criteria: Must fulfill two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria.

Major criteria: Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea, neck vein distention, rales, radiographic cardiomegaly, acute pulmonary oedema, S3 gallop, increased central venous pressure (>16 cm H\ :sub:`2`\O at right atrium), hepatojugular reflux; weight loss >4.5 kg in 5 days in response to treatment

Minor criteria: bilateral ankle oedema, nocturnal cough, dyspnoea on ordinary exertion, hepatomegaly, pleural effusion, decrease in vital capacity by one-third from maximum recorded, tachycardia (heart rate>120 beats/min).  
[Framingham]_

European Society of Cardiology: Typical signs (elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) and symptoms (eg, breathlessness, ankle swelling, and fatigue) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress.

**Input data:**\

**Ischemic Heart Disease** 

Other than inpatient hospital and inpatient claims data, we did not include any data from sources other than the literature for myocardial infarction. 

The primary input for the asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease following myocardial infarction model are 28-day survivors calculated from the excess mortality estimates for the myocardial infarction model. We included data for excess mortality and standardised mortality ratio to inform the estimates of survival after myocardial infarction.

**Heart Failure** 

We used literature data plus inpatient hospital data and claims to model the overall heart failure envelope. Additionally, we used the following data sources to estimate the proportion of heart failure attributable to each etiology: Vital Registry data from Mexico, Brazil, Taiwan, Colombia, and the US; Inpatient admissions from Friuli Venezia, Italy; and Linked Vital Registry data from Friuli Venezia, Italy. 

**Modelling strategy:**\

To estimate the burden of heart failure due to each of the underlying causes 
of heart failure, we first estimated the overall prevalence of heart failure 
and then the proportion of heart failure that could be attributed to each cause. 
The latter process includes an initial assessment of the fraction of heart 
failure cases attributable to each of six high‐level parent cause groupings, 
followed by further division into the detailed causes within each of these groupings. 

Etiological fraction estimation:

To estimate the proportion of heart failure attributable to each cause, we used Equation 1 to calculate the prevalence of heart failure due to each etiology, which was then scaled into a proportion. 

Equation 1:
:math:`\text{Prevalence}_{HF due to aetiology} = \frac{\text{Cause Specific Mortality Rate}_{HF due to aetiology}}{\text{Excess Mortaltiy Rate}_{HF due to aetiology}}`

First, we calculated the Cause Specific Mortality Rate (CSMR) for heart failure due to each etiology. We used age-, sex-, and location-specific CSMR (post CoDCorrect) for each etiology, multiplied by the fraction of deaths that also involved heart failure (Equation 2). This fraction was a modeled quantity, informed by person-level vital registry (VR) data from the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Taiwan, and Colombia, data sources which contained the underly­­ing cause of death as well as all codes in the causal chain. From these sources, we calculated the fraction of underlying deaths from each etiology in which heart failure was coded in the causal chain. These data were modeled in MR-BRT to generate age- and sex-specific estimates of this proportion. For Hypertensive Heart Disease, Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy, and Other Cardiomyopathy, we set the proportion to be 1, as all deaths due to these causes involve heart failure.  

Equation 2: 
:math:`\text{CSMR}_{HF due to aetiology} = \text{CSMR}_{aetiology} \times \text{Proportion deaths with HF}_{aetiology}`

Next, we estimated the Excess Mortality Rate (EMR) for heart failure due to each etiology. We used uniquely identified person-level hospital discharge data for the entire Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia, linked to all death records from the region. Inpatient data contained all primary and non-primary diagnoses associated with the visit, and mortality data contained the underlying cause of death as well as all codes in the causal chain. We identified patients with heart failure due to each etiology as individuals with hospital coded heart failure concurrent or after a hospital code of the etiology. Excess Mortality Rate for heart failure due to each etiology was calculated by subtracting the background mortality rate from the mortality rate of persons with heart failure due to that etiology. We modelled this quantity in MR-BRT to generate age- and sex-specific estimates of this value. Due to small number of deaths in younger ages, we assumed equal EMR across etiologies for ages under 45. 

We calculated the prevalence of Heart Failure due to each etiology using Equation 1. These were scaled to sum to one, generating the estimated proportions of Heart Failure due to each etiology.

These proportions, along with literature data, were used to inform DisMod models for the six broadest and mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive cause groupings: ischemic heart disease, hypertensive heart disease, cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, cardiopulmonary disease, and other cardiovascular and circulatory diseases. An exception to this approach was made for sub-Saharan Africa, where we excluded the proportion estimates generated from death data, relying instead on published literature to determine the proportions of heart failure etiologies. This decision was based on expert opinion that local patterns differed significantly from what would have been determined from death data. The THESUS‐HF study, a large-scale, prospective, echocardiographic study of heart failure etiologies in multiple African countries, provided these proportions.  
[THESUS]_

The results of these six proportion models were scaled to sum to one.  

For heart failure due to cardiopulmonary disease, heart failure due to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis, and heart failure due to other causes, we calculated the proportion for each sub-cause according to the proportion of that cause within each larger aggregate group. 

**Severity split inputs:**\

Acute myocardial infarction was split into two severity levels by length of time since the event – days 1 and 2 versus days 3 through 28. Disability weights were established for these two severities using the standard approach for GBD.

   :header-rows: 1

   * - Severity level
     - Lay description
     - DW (95% CI)
   * - Acute myocardial infarction, days 1-2
     - Has severe chest pain that becomes worse with any physical activity. The person feels nauseated, short of breath, and very anxious
     - 0.432 (0.288–0.579)

     - Gets short of breath after heavy physical activity, and tires easily, but has no problems when at rest. The person has to take medication every day and has some anxiety. 
     - 0.074 (0.049–0.105)

Asymptomatic ischaemic heart disease following myocardial infarction was all assigned to the asymptomatic severity level. No disability weight is assigned to this level.

     - Has chest pain that occurs with strenuous physical activity, such as running or lifting heavy objects. After a brief rest, the pain goes away.
     - 0.033 (0.02–0.052)
   * - Moderate heart failure due to IHD
     - Has chest pain that occurs with moderate physical activity, such as walking uphill or more than half a kilometer (around a quarter-mile) on level ground. After a brief rest, the pain goes away.
     - 0.08 (0.052–0.113)
   * - Severe heart failure due to IHD
     - Has chest pain that occurs with minimal physical activity, such as walking only a short distance. After a brief rest, the pain goes away. The person avoids most physical activities because of the pain.
     - 0.167 (0.11–0.24)

Residual heart failure was split into: treated (same as controlled or medically managed); mild; moderate; and severe heart failure based on an analysis of MEPS data.

   * - Severe
     - Is short of breath and feels tired when at rest. The person avoids any physical activity, for fear of worsening the breathing problems.  
     - 0.179 (0.122-0.251)

GBD 2019 Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Input data:**\

Vital registration and verbal autopsy data were used to model ischaemic heart disease.

[GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix-IHD]_

In GBD, heart failure is an impairment; deaths coded to heart failure by the reporting organization are reassigned to the underlying etiology by a process of redistribution. No estimates of mortality due to heart failure are produced by CODEm or CoDCorrect.

For this simulation, as simulants will be assigned to the heart failure state with an associated EMR, there will be deaths due to heart failure. This does not have a direct GBD comparison and should be validated carefully to ensure it matches expectations.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

The aspects of the disease this cause model is designed to simulate are the states, transitions, and sequelae. The Vivarium model of IHD has been of a similar design to GBD 2019 by modeling IHD using MI sequelae to estimate the prevalence of IHD. In addition, the full heart failure cause model is included here. Like GBD 2019, Vivarium's design includes several states:

  a) Acute myocardial infarction ('Acute MI' or AMI) is captured by two GBD sequelae and simulants should have myocardial infarction at the GBD IHD cause-level incidence rate. Vivarium's design of 'Acute MI' is modeled exactly after GBD 2019's 'Acute MI' case definition and informed by the GBD 2019 "Myocardial infarction due to ischemic heart disease - EMR comparison" DisMod model and sequelae.
  b) Post-MI is a state entered by survivors of AMI. Vivarium's design of 'Post MI' is modeled after part B of GBD 2019's 'Chronic IHD' case definition, which is captured in GBD as the "Asymptomatic Ischemic Heart Disease following myocardial infarction" DisMod model and sequelae.
  c) Heart failure due to IHD, also known as ischemic cardiomyopathy is modeled in GBD as part of IHD. For this simulation, it is a state that can be entered based on the incidence of heart failure due to IHD. It is included in the same cause model as myocardial infarction as these patients are also elgible for AMI. 
  d) Heart failure residual, is a state that can be entered based on the incidence of heart failure NOT due to IHD. It is included in the same cause model as myocardial infarction and heart failure from IHD to enforce mutual exclusivity. 

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The risk factor of BMI, SBP, LDL cholesterol, smoking, FPG, physical inactivity, total alcohol intake, processed meats, and sugar sweetened beverage could all affect the transition rates 1, 3, and 4, listed below, through the measures of incidence described in the table.

The excess mortality for all simulants with HF will be the EMR of the HF envelope, undifferentiated by etiology.

Post Processing
+++++++++++++++

While heart failure residual will operate as a single box in the cause model as 
shown above, there is a desire to have separate counts for incidence, prevalence,
and deaths separated into two categories: residual heart failure from hypertensive 
heart disease, and residual heart failure from other causes. 

As these causes are identical in all capacities, we think it is easier to make 
this designation in post processing rather than in the model itself. The rates of 
each group (HHD vs other) can be found in this `cvs file <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_nih_us_cvd/tree/main/src/vivarium_nih_us_cvd/data>`_. Note that this is different than the above proportions 
file. It is designed to give the percent of heart failure to assign to HHD in post 
processing from the residual heart failure cause ONLY. The IHD heart failure cause 
will not be adjusted in post processing. 

In all outcome tables that are separated by cause, the residual heart failure cause should be 
split in two causes. 

Assumptions
+++++++++++

#. To find the prevalence of AMI with and without HF, we assume it is distributed according to the prevalence of HF in the population. This is likely not true, but with the burn in, will have an opportunity to correct itself. 
#. We calculate a new IHD CSMR based on the EMRs and prevalences used. This is different than the GBD value which might lead to effects on the ACMR as well. 

Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

At the IHD cause level:

  - Validate that the simulation comes up with rates close to the GBD estimates for age-/sex-specific incidence, prevalence, excess mortality, and all-cause mortality rates
  - Compare the CSMR with GBD values, understanding that this might be significantly different
