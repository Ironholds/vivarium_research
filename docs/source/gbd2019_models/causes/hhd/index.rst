Disease Overview
----------------

Hypertensive heart disease refers to a constellation of changes in the left ventricle, left atrium and coronary arteries as a result of chronic blood pressure elevation, which increases the workload on the heart inducing structural and functional changes. These changes include hypertrophy of the left ventricle, which can progress to heart failure; patients with left ventricular hypertrophy have significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Hypertensive heart disease ultimately encompasses all of the direct and indirect sequelae of chronic high blood pressure which include systolic or diastolic heart failure, conduction arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, and increased risk of coronary artery disease.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

GBD 2019 Non-Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

In GBD, hypertensive heart disease is modeled as an outcome of the heart failure impairment envelope. The case definition for heart failure is a clinical diagnosis using structured criteria such as the Framingham or European Society of Cardiology criteria. Beginning in GBD 2016, we used ACC/AHA Stage C and above to capture both persons who are currently symptomatic and those who have been diagnosed with heart failure but are currently asymptomatic.

GBD 2019 Fatal Modeling Strategy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We included vital registration data in a standard CODEm approach to model hypertensive heart disease.

The following table describes any restrictions in GBD 2019 on the effects of
this cause (such as being only fatal or only nonfatal), as well as restrictions
on the ages and sexes to which the cause applies.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Scope
+++++

Hypertensive heart disease should occur at the incidence of HF in the DisMod model multiplied by the proportion of heart failure that is due to HHD. Heart failure due to HHD is then a chronic state without remission. Transition from prevalent HF due to hypertensive heart disease to death should occur at the GBD EMR rate from the HF DisMod model. The transition rate from the susceptible state to the prevalent state should be modified by systolic blood pressure and high body mass index. 

Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The proportion splits for HHD are the same for incidence and prevalence
