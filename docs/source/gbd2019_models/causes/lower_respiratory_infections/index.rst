Lower Respiratory Infections
============================

Disease Description
-------------------
Lower respiratory infections (*LRI*), principally clinician-diagnosed pneumonia
and bronchiolitis, is a major global killer of both children and adults. Symptoms
include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue. It is important to check for a fever. Symptoms can last about 7 days and the infection is contagious
to others shortly before and while experiencing symptoms. It is mainly
caused by four pathogens - Streptococcus pneumoniae (*pneumococcal
pneumonia*), Haemophilus influenzae type B (*Hib*), influenza, and respiratory
syncytial virus (*RCV*). Those pathogens may co-infect.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the largest cause of LRI
mortality. [Wikipedia]_, [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix]_

The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut
and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary),
bronchioles (including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli).
It also sometimes includes the larynx. [Wikipedia]_

Transmission of LRI may occur via several pathways, including direct physical contact,
fomites, direct droplet spread, and suspended small particles. Intermingling of
large numbers of people can facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens. [CDC]_

In GBD 2016, malnutrition was identified as a leading risk factor for lower respiratory infection
mortality among children younger than 5 years and, together with air pollution (both household and ambient)
and increased antibiotic use, was identified as a focus for targeted intervention measures. [Lancet]_

Modeling LRI in GBD 2019
------------------------

The GBD LRI model comprises a fatal and a nonfatal model.

LRI deaths are estimated using separate CODEm models for children under 5 and 
persons aged 5-95+, due to the significant difference in fatality patterns. These 
models run using CoD death from vital registration systems, surveillance 
systems, and verbal autopsy, along with a set of covariates discussed in more 
detail below.

The case definition used for the nonfatal LRI model is "clinician- diagnosed 
pneumonia or bronchiolitis". Primary data types include incidence and prevalence 
data from population surveys, scientific literature, and hospital/claims 
records. The modellers first adjust survey data for seasonality; then all input 
data with a non-reference case definition is adjusted using correction factors 
estimated with MR-BRT. The modellers defined time to recovery as 10 (5-15) days, 
which corresponds with a remission 36.5. The comprise the inputs for a DisMod 
model. LRI severity splits are obtained from a meta-analysis, and then the 
DisMod outputs are split according to severity before disablility weights for 
YLD calculation are applied.

A separate model is run for LRI etiologies, which both the fatal and nonfatal 
results are fit to.




..todo: ask sim science, and then gbd team, what "model-MR" is. different from dismod?





The 2019 set of covariates for the LRI CODEm models were updated slightly from those used in GBD 
2017, and include the following:

Nonfatal estimation:

Using prevalence and incidence data, GBD models overall nonfatal LRI burden.
