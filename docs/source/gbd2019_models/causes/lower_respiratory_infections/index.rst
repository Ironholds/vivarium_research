Lower Respiratory Infections
============================

Disease Description
-------------------
Lower respiratory infections (*LRI*), principally clinician-diagnosed pneumonia
and bronchiolitis, is a major global killer of both children and adults. Symptoms
include shortness of breath, weakness, fever, coughing and fatigue. It is important to check for a fever. Symptoms can last about 7 days and the infection is contagious
to others shortly before and while experiencing symptoms. It is mainly
caused by four pathogens - Streptococcus pneumoniae (*pneumococcal
pneumonia*), Haemophilus influenzae type B (*Hib*), influenza, and respiratory
syncytial virus (*RCV*). Those pathogens may co-infect.
Pneumococcal pneumonia is the largest cause of LRI
mortality. [Wikipedia]_, [GBD-2019-Capstone-Appendix]_

The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut
and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary),
bronchioles (including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli).
It also sometimes includes the larynx. [Wikipedia]_

Transmission of LRI may occur via several pathways, including direct physical contact,
fomites, direct droplet spread, and suspended small particles. Intermingling of
large numbers of people can facilitate transmission of respiratory pathogens. [CDC]_

In GBD 2016, malnutrition was identified as a leading risk factor for lower respiratory infection
mortality among children younger than 5 years and, together with air pollution (both household and ambient)
and increased antibiotic use, was identified as a focus for targeted intervention measures. [Lancet]_
