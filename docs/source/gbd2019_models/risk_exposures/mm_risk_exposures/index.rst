Multiple Myeloma Risk Factor Exposures
======================================

.. contents::
   :local:

We will follow the same strategy for risk factor exposures as in the
:ref:`Multiple Myeloma Phase 1 concept model
<2019_concept_model_vivarium_sanofi_multiple_myeloma>`. However, we will likely
handle race differently, perhaps omitting it entirely as a risk factor.

.. todo::

  Fill in details, referring to the :ref:`Risk factor model <mm5.3.2>` and
  :ref:`Risk factor exposure initialization <mm5.3.2.1>` sections in the Phase 1
  concept model.
