Fasting Plasma Glucose 
======================


Risk Exposure Overview
----------------------

Glucose is the primary energy source of the cells of the human body. Homeostasis of glucose metabolism is assessed by measuring plasma glucose levels either by 
measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG), performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or analyzing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). These measurements can be used 
to classify subjects as having normal glucose metabolism (FPG <100 mg/dL, OGTT <140 mg/dL, HbA1c <5.7%), impaired glucose metabolism (FPG 100 to 125 mg/dL, 
OGTT 140 to 199 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.7 to 6.4%), or diabetes mellitus (FPG ³126 mg/dL, OGTT ³200 mg/dL, HbA1c ³6.5%). HbA1c is specific for diabetes but not very sensitive 
and has greater utility to monitor diabetes control over 2 to 3 months.

Risk Exposures Description in GBD
---------------------------------

Include a description of this risk exposure model in the context of GBD, 
involving but not limited to:

  - What type of statistical model? (categorical, continuous?)

  - How is the exposure estimated? (DisMod, STGPR?)

  - Which outcomes are affected by this risk?

  - TMREL? (This should be a very high level overview. Namely, does the TMREL vary by outcome? The details of the TMREL will be included in the *Risk Outcome Relationship Model* section)

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

Include here an overview of the Vivarium modeling section

As of 02/10/2020: follow the template created by Ali for Iron Deficiency, copied 
below. If we discover it's not general enough to accommodate all exposure types,
we need to revise the format in coworking.
