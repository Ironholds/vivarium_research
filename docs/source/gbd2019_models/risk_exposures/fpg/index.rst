Fasting Plasma Glucose 
======================


Risk Exposure Overview
----------------------

Glucose is the primary energy source of the cells of the human body. Homeostasis of glucose metabolism is assessed by measuring plasma glucose levels either by 
measuring fasting plasma glucose (FPG), performing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or analyzing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c). These measurements can be used 
to classify subjects as having normal glucose metabolism (FPG <100 mg/dL, OGTT <140 mg/dL, HbA1c <5.7%), impaired glucose metabolism (FPG 100 to <126 mg/dL, 
OGTT 140 to 199 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.7 to 6.4%), or diabetes mellitus (FPG >=126 mg/dL, OGTT >=200 mg/dL, HbA1c >=6.5%). HbA1c is specific for diabetes but not very sensitive 
and has greater utility to monitor diabetes control over 2 to 3 months.

GBD 2019 Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

In GBD, FPG is modeled as a continuous variable using ST-GPR based on estimates of mean FPG in a representative population, individual-level data of fasting plasma glucose measured from surveys, or    
estimates of diabetes prevalence in a representative population. 

Fasting plasma glucose is frequently tested or reported in surveys aiming at assessing the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. In these surveys, the case definition of diabetes may include both a glucose 
test and questions about treatment for diabetes. People with positive history of diabetes treatment may be excluded from the FPG test. Thus, the mean FPG in these surveys would not represent the mean FPG 
in the entire population. In this event, we estimated the prevalence of diabetes assuming a definition of FPG>126 mg/dL (7mmol/L), then crosswalked it to our reference case definition, and then predicted 
mean FPG.   

The theoretical minimum-risk exposure level (TMREL) for FPG is 4.8-5.4 mmol/L for those risk-outcome pairs where risk is assessed on a continuous basis. This was calculated by taking the person-year 
weighted average of the levels of FPG that were associated with the lowest risk of mortality in the pooled analyses of prospective cohort studies. The TMREL is no diabetes for those outcomes where risk 
is assessed on a categorical basis. The risk-outcome pairs are listed below, along with whether they are continuous or categorical.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy

Scope
+++++

Mean FPG is a continuous exposure modelled in GBD. FPG will be a target of lifestyle interventions in the simulation; 
the outcomes affected are described in the overall concept model document.

   * - Age group end

     - [95, 125 years) 



Assumptions and Limitations
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The quantity of interest is exposure to the mean fasting plasma glucose level regardless of whether that 
level is naturally occurring or occurs via use of medication; we assume full reversibility of risk and 
do not account for duration of exposure to elevated FPG.

The exposure values should be used to represent the distribution of mean fasting plasma glucose 
levels that the simulants will be assigned in the model. 


Validation Criteria
+++++++++++++++++++

1. Does the mean in the model match the mean in GBD? 
2. Does the standard deviation in the model match the std in GBD?
