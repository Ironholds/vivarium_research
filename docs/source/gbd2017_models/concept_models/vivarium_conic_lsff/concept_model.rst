Design Decisions and Rationales
-------------------------------

Do not explicitly model neonatal disorders, meningitis, or other LBWSG-affected causes
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

For context, here are `treemaps for Nigeria and India on GBD Compare <http://ihmeuw.org/51tj>`_ showing that the majority of DALYs attributable to low birth weight and short gestation in the under-5 age groups are due to neonatal disorders, LRI, diarrhea, and meningitis.

Although the sub-causes of  :ref:`neonatal disorders
<2017_cause_neonatal_disorders>` account for the majority of disease burden in
the neonatal age groups, we are not explicitly modeling the neonatal causes in
this simulation. Instead, the relative risks from :ref:`low birth weight and
short gestation <2017_risk_lbwsg>` will directly affect each simulant's
mortality rate, which indirectly accounts for mortality due to neonatal
disorders and other causes like meningitis. Since iron fortification affects
birth weight and hence the relative risk of mortality that a simulant
experiences, this approach allows us to count how many deaths can be averted
from an increased birth weight resulting from iron fortification. This approach
ignores morbidity from neonatal disorders, meningitis, and other causes in the
neonatal age groups, but YLDs for neonates are negligible compared to YLLs (on
the order of 100 times smaller), so ignoring YLDs due to neonatal disorders and
other causes is not a concern.

Additional reasons for excluding neonatal disorders, meningitis, and other
causes affected by low birth weight and short gestation are as follows:

* The relative risks for :ref:`low birth weight and short gestation
  <2017_risk_lbwsg>` are not cause-specific, but rather apply to all-cause
  mortality. Thus it is simpler and more consistent with the input data to group
  all the LBWSG-affected causes together rather than modeling them explicitly,
  unless those causes need to interact with other model components (as is the
  case with :ref:`diarrheal diseases <2017_cause_diarrhea>` and :ref:`lower
  respiratory infections <2017_cause_lower_respiratory_infections>`, which are
  affectd by :ref:`vitamin A deficiency <2017_cause_vitamin_a_deficiency>`).

* Neonatal disorders is potentially problematic because:

  #. We know its (birth) prevalence does not include (birth) prevalence of
     :ref:`other neonatal disorders <2017_cause_neonatal_other>`, for which
     there is no data, and

  #. We know the relative risks are wrong for :ref:`preterm birth
     <2017_cause_neonatal_preterm>` because this sub-cause is PAF-of-1 with
     LBWSG.

* Meningitis is potentially problematic because we have not successfully
  modeled it before. In our initial attempt to include meningitis in the BEP
  model, the simulated meningitis CSMR significantly underestimated the GBD CSMR
  for meningitis in all age groups.

* Other causes affected by LBWSG, such as encephalitis, upper respiratory
  infections, and otitis media, have very few DALYs attributable to LBWSG. Thus
  it is not worth the effort to model these causes explicitly, though averted
  YLLs due to these cause will in theory be captured by the above strategy of
  using the LBWSG relative risks to affect the overall mortality rate of
  simulants.
