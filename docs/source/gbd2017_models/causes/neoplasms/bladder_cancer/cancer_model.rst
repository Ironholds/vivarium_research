Cause Model Diagram
-------------------

According to GBD 2017, cancer cases are considered cured if the patient survives more than 10 years. But, there is no data available for remission rate 
which makes it difficult to transition through the states. So, due to data limitations we are simplifying the model.
 
Note: This simpliflication might over estimate the number of deaths.
