This documentation focuses on treatment and management of acute malnutrition in Ethiopia based on 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_

The prevalence of stunting in Ethiopia has declined from 58% in 2000 to 38% in 2016. However, the prevalence of wasting has remained fairly static at 12% in 2000 and 10% in 2016. To address malnutrition in all its forms, the Government is applying two programmatic approaches. The first focuses on increasing access to and availability of food through improved economic growth, better agricultural production systems along with promotion of good nutrition practices and prevention of malnutrition. The second approach aims to strengthen early warning systems and timely emergency response, including wide-scale delivery of services for the management of acute
malnutrition.

The Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH) developed the first Protocol for the Management of Severe Acute
Malnutrition (SAM) in 2007, and the Guideline for the Management of Moderate Acute Malnutrition (MAM)
in 2012. This is the latest National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition in Ethiopia (2019). It includes the latest World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines and recommendations, and emerging national and international evidence. It is also aligned to the National Nutrition Programme (NNP) II 2016-2020, the National Food and Nutrition Policy and the Health Sector Transformation Plan (HSTP) 2015/16 - 2019/20.

Intervention Overview
---------------------

This flow chart summarizes the core aspects of the care and treatment for SAM and MAM, and integration into the
routine health system.

.. todo::

   Add a general narrative overview of the intervention, including what it is, what outcomes it affects, if/how/when/where it has been used, etc.

.. _1.1:

Health system delivery
++++++++++++++++++++++

Interventions for wasting treatment are delivered through different levels of the health system.

:underline:`Community and household level`
 
 Community outreach ensures early identification of SAM and MAM cases. Community outreach also aims to empower communities and families to understand the causes of malnutrition, and prevent and manage acute malnutrition in their communities. Health Extension Workers (HEWs) collaborate with the community-based structures such as health committees and engage with the Health Development Army (HDA)/Health Development Group (HDG) to screen and refer cases to the appropriate service for treatment.

:underline:`Health post level`

 The HPs provide primary health care services such as disease prevention and control, hygiene and environmental sanitation, family health services, and health education and communication. The service provider at the HP works closely with the network of the HDA/HDG to facilitate the management of SAM and MAM. The
 service provider diagnoses acute malnutrition and provides Outpatient Therapeutic Programme (OTP) and Targeted Supplementary Feeding Programme (TSFP) services. They also determine patients who have medical complications and refer them to the Stablisation Centre (SC).

:underline:`Health center level`

 The HC provides 24-hour SC for the management of SAM with medical complications. The HC also manages and provides technical support to a cluster of one to five HPs within its vicinity.

:underline:`Hospital level`

 Woreda, Zonal, Regional and referral Hospitals provide higher level referral points where further care can be provided to patients with SAM and more complex medical complications. The referral Hospitals have the facilities and expertise to manage situations that may require administration of oxygen, blood transfusion, and other critical care.

.. _2.0:

Assessing and classifying acute malnutrition
--------------------------------------------

The classification of SAM and MAM cases is derived from the 2019 National Guideline for the Management of Acute Malnutrition. [EMOH]_

:download:`2019 guidelines<guidelines_2019.pdf>`

.. note:: 
  
  - Based on the guideline, we will need to make some modelling decisions on how we classifiy SAM, MAM, NONE and think about how it may bias our results. 

  - The ORs and ANDs in the classifications are not very clear or consistent in the guideline. It would be useful if we can clarify with a clinician when it should be OR/AND? 

  - I think for our model we will probably classify according to the WHZ scores, but it would be good to get an idea if that over-estimates or under-estimates SAM and MAM compared to classification criteria in the guideline. 


.. _2.1:

In infants 0-6 months
+++++++++++++++++++++

:underline:`Classify SAM with or without medical complications`

* Any grade of bilateral pitting oedema (+, ++ or +++) OR
* WFL < -3 zscore OR
* Recent weight loss or failure to gain weight OR
* Ineffective feeding (attachment, positioning and suckling) directly observed for 15-20, minutes, ideally in supervised separate area OR
* Presence of any of the following medical complications:

  - Poor appetite
  - Intractable vomiting
  - Convulsions
  - Lethargy, not alert
  - Unconsciousness
  - High fever (≥38.5 °C)
  - Pneumonia (Chest indrawing, fast breathing)
  - Dehydration
  - Persistent diarrhoea
  - Severe anaemia
  - Hypoglycaemia
  - Hypothermia
  - Severe skin lesions
  - Eye signs of vitamin A deficiency

**Treatment**

NOTE: All infants 0-6 months of age with SAM with or without medical complications should be referred to the SC.

.. note::

  The WHO classification criteria for infants 0-6mo is 

    1) weight-for-length <–3 Z-scores of the WHO Child Growth Standards median, or
    2) presence of bilateral pitting oedema 


:underline:`Classify MAM`

* MUAC of lactatating mother of infant 0-6 months <23.0 cm
* WFH ≥-3 to <-2 zscores AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema AND 
* No medical complications
* Clinically well and alert

**Treatment** 

Assess the infant’s feeding and counsel the mother or caregiver on appropriate IYCF practices. Emphasize on establishing effective exclusive
breastfeeding. If feeding problems, follow up in 5 days. If no feeding problem, follow up in 30 days. Admit the mother to TSFP. Refer the mother for Productive Safety Net Programme (PSNP).

:underline:`Classify no acute malnutrition`

* WFH ≥-2 zscores AND 
* No bilateral pitting oedema

**Treatment** 

Congratulate and counsel the mother on appropriate IYCF practices.

  Fill out the following table with a list of known outcomes affected by the intervention, regardless of if they will be included in the simulation model or not, as it is important to recognize potential unmodeled effects of the intervention and note them as limitations as applicable.

Baseline Coverage Data

Let us assume program coverage is a stand-in value of 40%. C = 0.4; 1-C = 0.6 (This will be updated). 

.. todo::

  We have been in contact with EMOH but seems like they only have DHIS data which does not give us coverage rate. We will dig a bit more into the literature, or reach out to CIFF/UNICEF since UNICEF is the implementation partner for treatment in Ethiopia.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

.. image:: treatment_diagram.svg
   :alt: Compartmental diagram with treatment

For MAM 

  - :math:`r3 =  r3_{ux}\times(1-C) + r3_{tx}\times(C)`
  - :math:`d2 =  d2_{ux}\times(1-C) + d2_{tx}\times(C)`
  - :math:`i1 =  i1_{ux}\times(1-C) + i1_{tx}\times(C)`

For SAM

 - :math:`r2 =  r2_{ux}\times(1-C) + r2_{tx}\times(C)`
 - :math:`d1 =  d1_{ux}\times(1-C) + d1_{tx}\times(C)`





.. todo::

  Add an overview of the Vivarium modeling section.
  - We have r3, d2, i1, r2 and d1 from solving the wasting compartmental modeling (missing duration of cat3 as constraint)
  - Need to find programmatic data to obtain r3tx, d2tx, i1tx, r2tx and d1tx
  - Get coverage rate (currently use 0.4 as stand-in)
  - We can then derive r3ux, d2ux, i1ux, r2ux and d1ux
