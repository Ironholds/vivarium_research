TB is the leading infectious cause of deaths globally, with particularly high 
disease burden in low to middle-income countries. Treatment for LTBI patients 
can reduce their risk of progression to (active/symptomatic) TB. WHO guidelines 
recommend that high-risk populations such as **PLHIV** and **U5 HHC**, should 
receive TPT in order to achieve TB elimination per the WHO End TB strategy.

Intervention Overview
---------------------

CSU client has a long history in TB control and offers programmatic support 
with partners from the global Stop TB initiative. As part of its commitment to 
reduce the burden of TB, they developed rifapentine as part of a short-course 
combination therapy, which may increase adherence, and treatment completion 
rates compared to alternative long-course LTBI treatment isoniazid. Modeling 
the scale-up of two treatment options listed below can allow us to compare the 
impact of these two treatments for LTBI on reducing TB burden.

- Treatment option 1 (**6H**): daily isoniazid monotherapy administered daily 
  for six months
- Treatment option 2 (**3HP**): A short-course combination treatment, rifapentine 
  and isoniazid, administered for three months once a week

The table below provides parameters and related data sources for LTBI intervention model.

Treatment Coverage Data
+++++++++++++++++++++++

We aim to project the scale-up of TPT reaching 95% coverage of two high-risk 
populations in five high-burden countries in order to access the TB-related 
health outcomes over a five-year timeframe. We used LTBI treatment coverage 
target from country-specific NSP to inform the **linear projection over 5 
years**, assuming all countries presented below can reach 95% coverage in 2025.

Vivarium Modeling Strategy
--------------------------

The treatment model links interventions (6H and 3HP) to the likelihood of 
advancing from LTBI to active TB, thus affecting TB incidence, deaths, and DALYs.

Treatment adherence and efficacy
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. important::

  An adherent patient in this simulation is defined as:
   - Simulated patient treated with 6H: participants who take drug â‰¥ 70%-85% of days prescribed.
   - Simulated patient treated with 3HP: participants who completed 11 out 12 courses.

.. todo::

  1. Add RR formula for no treatment versus adherent
  2. Add RR formula for non-adherent versus adherent

Treatment Algorithm
-------------------

.. todo::

  1. Add treatment flowchart
  2. Describe treatment flowchart


Assumptions and Limitations
---------------------------

1. In this simulation, patients are not eligible for retreatment after receiving 
   TPT, regardless of whether the simulated patient completes the full course of 
   treatment or not.
2. We assume same efficacy for 6H and 3HP because there are literature evidence 
   demonstrated that 6HP is non-inferior to 3HP on protecting patients progress 
   from LTBI to active TB. [citation]
3. 3HP is not suitable for children under two. Instead, we treat them with 6H.


Validation and Verification Criteria
