Small quantity lipid based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS)
========================================================

Ideally, infants are breastfed for two years or longer, with complementary food introduced at six months of age. Diets of infants and young children aged six to 23 months need to include a variety of nutrient-dense foods, preferably from local sources, to ensure their nutrient needs are met. However, children's diets are likely to be deficient in macronutrients and micronutrients, specifically essential fatty acids, when nutrient-rich diets are not available to them in resource-poor settings. Various interventions are recommended, or have been used, to improve child malnutrition. This document focuses on small quantity lipid based nutrient supplements (SQ-LNS) as an intervention to improve malnutrition, particularly child wasting and stunting. Particularly, it draws on the 2019 Cochrane Review by Das et. al. [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_

Intervention Overview
-----------------------

:underline:`Lipid-based nutrient supplements`

Supplementary feeding is a strategy that includes provision of extra food to children beyond the normal ration of their home diets
and is aimed at improving the nutritional status or preventing the nutritional deterioration of the target population. One of the nutritional
interventions advocated to address malnutrition among children is **lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS)**. LNS are a family of
products designed to deliver nutrients to vulnerable people. They are considered 'lipid-based' because most of the energy provided
by these products is from lipids (fats). All LNS provide a range of vitamins and minerals, but unlike most other micronutrient supplements,
LNS also provide *energy, protein and essential fatty acids*. LNS recipes can include a variety of ingredients, but typically have included vegetable fat, peanut or groundnut paste, milk powder and sugar. Based on the energy content, LNS can be small quantity (SQ LNS) providing ˜ 110 to 120 kcal/day (20 g dose), medium quantity (MQ LNS) providing ˜ 250 to 500 kcal/day (45 g to 90 g dose) or large-quantity (LQ LNS) providing
more than 280 kcal/day (> 90 g dose).LNS are nutrient dense, require no cooking before use, and can be stored for months even in warm conditions. 
[DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_

:underline:`Alternative recipes and formulations, other than LNS`

Alternative recipes and formulations, other than LNS, are currently being explored using cereals mixed with other ingredients, including
whey, soy protein isolate, dried skimmed milk, and sesame, cashew and chickpea paste, among others. These are
fortified with vitamins and minerals and are commonly called **fortified blended foods (FBF)**. An example of a commonly used FBF
is **corn soy blend plus (CSB ++)**, which is a cooked blend of milled, heat-treated corn and soybeans that is fortified with a vitamin and
mineral premix. **Multiple micronutrient powders (MNP)** are also an alternative way of providing micronutrients. These are single-dose
packets of vitamins and minerals in powder form that can be sprinkled onto any ready to eat semi-solid food consumed at home,
school or any other point of use. [DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019]_


:underline:`Description of intervention`

The intervention is the supplementation of children from aged **6 months to 23 months** with **LNS + complementary feeding** (intervention) compared with no intervention (control). The setting of the intervention is the community. 

.. note::

  - Most studies included children aged six months to 18 months (Adu- Afarwuah 2007; Adu-Afarwuah 2016; Ashorn 2015; Bisimwa 2012; Christian 2015; Hess 2015; Iannotti 2014; Kumwenda 2014; Mangani 2015; Matias 2017; Phuka 2008; Siega-Riz 2014). 
  - Four studies included children aged six to 24 months (Dewey 2017; Olney 2018; Luby   2018; Null 2018) and 
  - one study included children aged six to 36 months (Huybregts 2012). 
  - Four included studies enrolled pregnant women and provided lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNS) plus complementary feeding during pregnancy and post-partum, followed by infant supplementation at six months of age (Adu-Afarwuah 2016; Ashorn 2015; Dewey 2017; Olney 2018). However, Dewey 2017 had an intervention arm in which only children were supplemented, hence we only used the data from that arm in the analysis in this review. The other studies provided LNS plus complementary feeding to children after six months of age. * The review conducted a sensitivity analysis by removing trials that also supplemented pregnant women with LNS in addition to children (Adu-Afarwuah 2016; Ashorn 2015), and found no significant difference in the outcome (Analysis 1.3; Analysis 1.4 in Das DAS_Cochrane_Review_2019).

Affected Outcomes

:underline:`Outcome #1: moderate wasting`

For the outcome moderate wasting, the review compared prevalence of **moderate wasting** at 18 or 24 months between intervention and control children. LNS plus complementary feeding reduced the prevalence of moderate wasting by 18% (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91; eight studies; 13,172 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was *no impact* of LNS plus complementary feeding on **severe wasting** (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.46; three studies, 2329 participants)

We will apply the relative risk ratio as a relative rate ratio on the incidence of MAM from MILD (i2) starting from the age-start of the intervention starts (6 months). This is because we assume that the intervention does not affect the duration of disease and hence:

| Prevalence_intervention 
| = 0.82 x (prevalence_baseline_6mo) 
| = 0.82 x (incidence_baseline_6mo) x Duration_baseline

.. todo::
  
  Try this out in the nano-sim to see how the intervention affects moderate wasting prevalence when RR applied to i2. 

.. todo::
  
  Think about whether we want to apply the full reduction in incidence at 6 months or we have a gradual reduction in incidence, reaching full reduction at 18 months? 
  Answer: we will start simple and apply immediately to 6 months. We can add complexity later. 

:underline:`Outcome #2 and #3: moderate and severe stunting`

LNS plus complementary feeding reduced the prevalence of **moderate stunting** by 7% (risk ratio (RR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 0.98; nine studies, 13,372 participants; moderate-quality evidence), **severe stunting** by 15% (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98; five studies, 6151 participants; moderate-quality evidence), 

We will apply the relative risk ratio on the propensity of stunting starting from the age-start of the intervention starts (6 months). See below example for male, age 6mo-11mo, 2020 stunting prevalence.
