Individuals were enrolled in the diabetes prevention program if their BMI was >= 25, they had no known DM2, and their FPG was 100-125mg/dl (or HgbA1C 5.7-6.4). They attended a median of 14 community-based sessions over a median of 134 days. Sessions included lifestyle and behavior counselling with a focus on increasing moderate physical activity, healthy eating, and weight loss. Each additional session attended led to 0.31% loss of body weight.
