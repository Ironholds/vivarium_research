Vivarium Modeling Strategy - Polypill Intervention 
--------------------------------------------------

  Add an overview of the Vivarium modeling section.

  Address comment: I expect this to reference the hypertension treatment doc and describe how some ramp positions can be achieved by a polypill; it should say what the effect of polypill is on adherence, and who gets polypill (perhaps with reference to the scenarios.rst description of what the coverage of polypill is in your alternative scenarios.)

Decision tree and algorithm for polypill intervention

**Source information:**

Individuals with prevalent IHD, past ischemic stroke, prevalent PAD, or 5-year CVD risk of 15% or greater received a free 6-month-at-a-time supply of a polypill of either version 1 (aspirin, 75 mg; simvastatin, 40 mg; lisinopril, 10 mg; and atenolol, 50 mg) or version 2 (aspirin, 75 mg; simvastatin, 40 mg; lisinopril, 10 mg; and hydrochlorothiazide, 12.5 mg). Compared with usual care, at 12 months, the polypill group was more likely to be adherent with medications (adjRR 1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18).

**Implementation:**

Adherence to blood pressure lowering and statin medications over 1 year after initiation should be increased according to the above study, though in this scenario we will actually deliver the following combination: atorvastatin (10 mg), amlodipine (2.5 mg), losartan (25 mg), and hydrochlorothiazide (12.5 mg). Effect can persist beyond the length of the study.
