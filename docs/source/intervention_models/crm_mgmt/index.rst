==================================================
Cardiometabolic Risk Management Intervention Model
==================================================

This model includes behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions aimed
at: 1) improving blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol control, 2)
increasing exercise, 3) decreasing BMI/weight, 4) improving control of
fasting plasma glucose, and 5) decreasing tobacco use. Intervening to
change an individual's risk factor exposures will improve outcomes for
many GBD causes.

This model requires a simulant to have attributes of: age, sex, SBP,
LDL-C, BMI, FPG, smoking.

It adds attributes of: untreated SBP, untreated LDL-C, untreated BMI,
untreated FPG, untreated smoking, polypill prescription, htn
prescription ramp position, llt prescription, lifestyle modification
education status, medication outreach status, adherence propensity,
adherence status, last measured SBP, last measured LDL-C, follow-up
visit propensity, LDL-C prescription initiation propensity, SBP
prescription initiation propensity, polypill initiation propensity

Intervention Overview
-----------------------

Vivarium has been used in several cardiovascular disease simulations
to date, and in this version, we will include pharmaceutical treatment
of high SBP and high LDL Cholesterol with individual and polypill
therapies, as well as education to support lifestyle
modification. Alternative scenarios will consider expanded
implementation of medical outreach, which is known to increase
treatment initiation, as well as expanded access to polypill
treatment, which is known to increase adherence.

.. todo::

  Fill out the following table with a list of known outcomes affected by the intervention, regardless of if they will be included in the simulation model or not, as it is important to recognize potential unmodeled effects of the intervention and note them as limitations as applicable.

  The table below provides example entries for large scale food fortification with iron.
