Vivarium Modeling Strategy - Outreach Intervention 
**************************************************

Overview
++++++++

Adherence to SBP and LDL-c lowering therapies would increase through patient outreach. Methods for outreach include 
regular phone calls between provider and patient, a mobile app with reminders and guidance, or a patient support clinic.

Today, few patients receive this support and adherence to medications is often low. This intervention will assess the 
impact of an outreach intervention on risk factors and CVD. 


Eligibility and Initiation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- SBP >=130 mmHg and/or LDL-c >= 2.6 mmol/L 
- Must have an acute qualifying event (acute myocardial infarction or acute ishemic stroke) 
- Enrollment in the intervention only happens during interactions with healthcare, as shown :ref:`here <us_cvd_concept_model>`


Affected Outcomes
+++++++++++++++++

This intervention affects adherence to medications, which in turn will affect the simulants exposure to SBP and LDL-c.

  Is initiation assumed to be 100%?  


**Source information:**

Black patients, when prescribed statin as a new medication within the past 1 year, receive automated phone calls and letters starting 1-2 weeks after prescribing, which encourages them to fill the prescription (primary adherence). Receiving this intervention increases fill and initiation of statin from 26% to 42% of patients. OR for intervention vs control was 2.16 (1.91-2.43). Effectively, patients were twice as likely to initiate medication during the first 30 days if intervention was delivered.

Patients, age 30-60 without IHD, but who met any of the following criteria: current tobacco smoker, LDL-c > 3.37 mmol/L, or SBP >140 mmHg, received access to a non-clinical community health center with nurse-practitioner counseling on diet, tobacco use, and exercise. Telephone follow-up and free YMCA exercise sessions were offered. The comparison group received standard of care. Both groups had medication copays covered. At 1 year, statin adherence had a relative odds of 2.2 (95% CI 1.11-4.2) and blood pressure medication adherence had a relative odds of 2.3 (95% CI 1.39-3.88) compared to the control group.
