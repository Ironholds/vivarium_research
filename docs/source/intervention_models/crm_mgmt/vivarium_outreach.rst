Vivarium Modeling Strategy - Outreach Intervention 
**************************************************

Overview
++++++++

Adherence to SBP-lowering and LDL-c lowering therapies would increase through patient outreach. Methods for outreach would include options such as regular phone calls between provider and patient, a mobile app with reminders and guidance about the importance of taking medications, or a patient support clinic.

All patients with an SBP level >=130 mmHg and/or LDL-c level >=2.6 mmol/L or who have had an acute qualifying event are eligible for enrollment into this intervention. Acute qualifying events include an acute myocardial infarction or acute ischemic stroke during the preceeding time step.

When a simulant is enrolled in the outreach intervention, the initial medication fill rate is increased 2x and the medication adherence each month is increased 2x for each prescription.

Details of the drug classes and dosage options for both blood pressure and lipid-lowering can be found in the treatment documentation linked below.

**Source information:**

Black patients, when prescribed statin as a new medication within the past 1 year, receive automated phone calls and letters starting 1-2 weeks after prescribing, which encourages them to fill the prescription (primary adherence). Receiving this intervention increases fill and initiation of statin from 26% to 42% of patients. OR for intervention vs control was 2.16 (1.91-2.43). Effectively, patients were twice as likely to initiate medication during the first 30 days if intervention was delivered.

Patients, age 30-60 without IHD, but who met any of the following criteria: current tobacco smoker, LDL-c > 3.37 mmol/L, or SBP >140 mmHg, received access to a non-clinical community health center with nurse-practitioner counseling on diet, tobacco use, and exercise. Telephone follow-up and free YMCA exercise sessions were offered. The comparison group received standard of care. Both groups had medication copays covered. At 1 year, statin adherence had a relative odds of 2.2 (95% CI 1.11-4.2) and blood pressure medication adherence had a relative odds of 2.3 (95% CI 1.39-3.88) compared to the control group.
