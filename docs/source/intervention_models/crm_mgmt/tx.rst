Blood pressure and lipid-lowering medications

blood pressure llt 


Medication initiation:
All simulants enrolled in the intervention initiate treatment (defined as initial fill of prescription(s))

Adherence:
All simulants get number from 0 to 1 drawn from non-uniform distribution of adherence in the general population [need to find]. Simulants with values >=0.8 are considered adherent and receive the full benefit of their medication.

ASCVD Risk score
score = -19.5 + 0.043 * sbp + 0.266 * age + 2.32 * sex

On each time step, follow this a decision tree to adjust the treatment for a simulant: (a) does simulant interact with health system? Answer depends on outpatient visit rate, emergency visit if simulant had a heart attack, follow-up visit scheduled time and adherence rate.
If (a) is yes, if visit is for an emergency, (b) does provider overcome therapeutic inertia?
If (b) is yes, increase treatment for SBP and/or LDL-C
If (b) is no, (c) does measured SBP and/or measured LDL-C exceed threshold for increased treatment?
If (c) is yes, (d) does provider overcome therapeutic inertia?
If (d) is yes, increase treatment for SBP and/or LDL-C
If treatment was increased for SBP and/or LDL-C, (e) does patient initiate new prescription?
If patient has initiated a prescription (on this timestep or previously), (f) does patient adhere to treatment?
[[to add: schedule follow-up visit, give polypill instead of separate pills, refer to lifestyle medication education, enroll in medical outreach. Also make sure to document data sources for all parameters, e.g. probability simulant has outpatient visit to help answer (a) in simulation.]]





.. todo:: add link to stash repo with collapse code 
.. todo:: update with file for LDL 
.. todo:: add section describing adherence initialization; like a categorical risk factor; documentation like a dichotomous RF
