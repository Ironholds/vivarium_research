Hemoglobin distribution weighting strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the continuous hemoglobin distribution parameters, rather than population-weight the mean and standard deviation of the continuous distribution and then sample from those summary statistics, we will instead **sample individual simulant hemoglobin exposures from the national-level distributions with a probability equal to the population weight of that nation within the modeled region among all women of reproductive age.** Although the hemoglobin distribution and population size parameters are age-specific, we will calculate the population weights among women of reproductive age overall rather than at the age specific level to allow us to sample from the same national-level distribution for the same simulant as they age so that we can maintain logical hemoglobin exposure trajectories at the simulant level. 

Specifically, at the simulant level, the country from which the hemoglobin exposure is sampled should be determined at initialization or entrance into the simulation and should not change for the duration of the simulation. Notably, although simulants' sampling country and hemoglobin exposure propensities will not change throughout the simulation, their hemoglobin exposure values may change as they progress to the next age group (as described in the :ref:`hemoglobin document <2019_hemoglobin_model>`). The sampling probabilities for each country within the modeled regions are defined below.

Probability of sampling from a given country's hemoglobin distribution using the mean and standard deviation hemoglobin parameters for that country:

  \frac{population_\text{country}}{population_\text{region}}

     - 57 years (track through the 56th year until the start of the 57th year)
     - Maximum age of tracking in simulation. Allows capture of potential events for pregnancies that occur at the end of the 54th year, including maximum gestation period and 1 year post-maternal disorder state.
   * - Sex restrictions
     - Female only
     - 

.. todo::

  The GBD defines reproductive age as 10 to 54 years of age. However, many other data sources define reproductive age as 15 to 49 years of age. 

  We should confirm with the BMGF that they would like to model the GBD definition rather than standard definition from other data sources. 

.. note::

  The overall fertility rate among women of reproductive age is 0.055 for South Asia and 0.105 for Sub-Saharan Africa (not including stillbirths). Therefore, approximately these fractions of the total population multiplied by the number of simulation years of WRA will enter the population of interest of PLW in our simulation.

     - `Notebook for validation can be found here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/model0/model_0_gbd_validation.ipynb>`_. All-cause mortality rates look good. Age fraction looks reasonable, but slightly off for boundary age groups, likely a result of the assumption of uniform distribution of ages within a five year age group -- ok to proceed.
   * - I.1
     - Pregnancy model for Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
     - `Validation notebook can be found here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/maternal/model1/sim_v_and_v.ipynb>`_. [1] ASFR covariate has negative values in the youngest age group for some draws... perhaps should update to truncated normal distribution. [2] duration of postpartum period appears to be too long... closer to 7 weeks than 6. [3] Request to have pregnancy person time stratified by pregnancy outcome in order to evaluate approximate differential duration of pregnancy. [4] Request to have all pregnancy transition counts rather than just np->p.
   * - I.2
     - Maternal disorders
     - `Validation notebooks are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model2%2C%20maternal%20disorders>`_. [1] mortality rate due to other causes overestimated by a factor of approximately 50 (this is a new problem that was not present in model I.1). [2] rates (among women of reproductive age) AND ratios (per pregnancy) for both maternal disorders incidence AND mortality all overestimated. [3] Ratio of fatal to incident maternal disorders cases looks off for Sub-Saharan Africa, but is underestimated for South Asia. [4] previous issues appear to remain unresolved.
