3.1 Additional figures
-----------------------

There are several components that affect hemoglobin during pregnancy, including in multiplicative (for the hemoglobin pregnancy adjustment factor) and additive (for the :ref:`antenatal supplementation <maternal_supplementation_intervention>`, :ref:`antenatal IV iron <intervention_iv_iron_antenatal>`, and :ref:`postpartum IV iron <intervention_iv_iron_postpartum>` interventions as well as :ref:`maternal hemorrhage risk effects <2019_risk_effect_maternal_hemorrhage>`) manners. The figures below visually represent these changes.

.. image:: hemoglobin_trajectory_plot.png

.. note::

  The depiction above does not represent hemoglobin exposure value changes due to changing age groups, which will happen in the vivarium simulation. The following figure shows how changing age groups may change simulant hemoglobin exposure.

  Simulants should have the same propensity value for all modeled interventions (if coverage of all modeled interventions is 50%, then the same 50% of simulants will be getting each intevention). Additionally, treatment propensity is fixed throughout the simulation and does not update between multiple pregnancies.

  Also, the same propensity should be used for the effect size on of both the antenatal and postpartum IV iron interventions (referenced below) on hemoglobin.

Hemoglobin distribution weighting strategy
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For the continuous hemoglobin distribution parameters, rather than population-weight the mean and standard deviation of the continuous distribution and then sample from those summary statistics, we will instead **sample individual simulant hemoglobin exposures from the national-level distributions with a probability equal to the population weight of that nation within the modeled region among the age-specific population size of women of reproductive age (WRA).** 

Specifically, at the simulant level, the country from which the hemoglobin exposure is sampled should be determined at initialization or entrance into the simulation and should not change for the duration of the simulation. Notably, although simulants' sampling country and hemoglobin exposure propensities will not change throughout the simulation, their hemoglobin exposure values may change as they progress to the next age group (as described in the :ref:`hemoglobin document <2019_hemoglobin_model>`). The sampling probabilities for each country within the modeled regions are defined below.

Probability of sampling from a given country's hemoglobin distribution using the mean and standard deviation hemoglobin parameters for that country:

.. math::

  \frac{population_\text{country}}{population_\text{region}}

    - Age-specific population size of women of reproductive age for a given regional location
    - :math:`\sum_{country=1}^{n} population_\text{country}`
    - For all countries within the region

.. note:: 

  We may update the weighting unit to pregnant and lactating women (PLW) rather than WRA once we have confirmed that our hemoglobin exposure model is functioning properly by validating to GBD. Although the hemoglobin exposure distribution is specific to women of reproductive age, we have chosen to weight the hemoglobin exposure distribution to the population size of pregnant and lactating women due to our explicit project focus on PLW. This prioritization of hemoglobin exposures among PLW may cause slight differences in our location-aggregated estimates of anemia among non-pregnant or postpartum simulants among WRA compared to the regional estimates from GBD.

  Although the hemoglobin distribution and population size parameters are age-specific, we will calculate the population weights among PLW overall rather than at the age specific level to allow us to sample from the same national-level distribution for the same simulant as they age so that we can maintain logical hemoglobin exposure trajectories at the simulant level.

   * - Sex restrictions

.. todo::

  The GBD defines reproductive age as 10 to 54 years of age. However, many other data sources define reproductive age as 15 to 49 years of age. 

  We should confirm with the BMGF that they would like to model the GBD definition rather than standard definition from other data sources. 

.. note::

  The overall fertility rate among women of reproductive age is 0.055 for South Asia and 0.105 for Sub-Saharan Africa (not including stillbirths). Therefore, approximately these fractions of the total population multiplied by the number of simulation years of WRA will enter the population of interest of PLW in our simulation.

All-cause mortality rates look good.

     - `Validation notebooks are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model2%2C%20maternal%20disorders>`_. [1] mortality rate due to other causes overestimated by a factor of approximately 50 (this is a new problem that was not present in model I.1). [2] seeing age trend in maternal disorders burden attributable to differences bewteen rate of conception and rate of birth within each age group. [3] Underestimating maternal disorders burden relative to GBD overall [4] previous issues appear to remain unresolved.

   * - I.3updates
     - Updated hemoglobin weighting from WRA to PLW, fixed birth outcome initialization issue, fixed pregnancy transition from all states issue, fixed some person-time issues. 
     - `Notebooks are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model3%20with%20first%20round%20fixes>`_ [1] Underestimation of maternal hemorrhage incidence remains (note: does not vary by year so likely not related to intiailization and also the ratio between moderate and severe looks as expected). [2] Hemoglobin/anemia still not totally validating. [3] The following issues were resolved: pregnancy state durations look good, birth outcome rates look good, hemoglobin pregnancy adjustment factor looks good. [4] Birth outcome counts are equal to transitions out of pregnancy state, which is appropriate (need to check and make sure it's possible for death due to maternal disorders to result in birth outcome!). Ali to investigate hemoglobin and anemia thresholds look as they should in an interactive sim.
   * - I.3 hemorrhage fix
     - Fixed issues of maternal hemorrhage incidence using GBD incidence rate rather than the probability listed :ref:`on this page <2019_cause_maternal_hemorrhage_incidence>` and observers counting multiple outcomes.
     - `Maternal hemorrhage incidence looks good! Now only off by the age-group trend previously identified <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/maternal/model3%2C%20hemorrhage%20fix/maternal%20disorders%20cause%20model.ipynb>`_.
   * - I.3 hemoglobin weighted to single national location
     - Weighted 100% of simulants to the hemoglobin distributions of Nigeria for the Sub-Saharan Africa location and to Bangladesh for the South Asia location to see if our validation issues were caused by our location aggregation strategy.
     - `Mean hemoglobin is validating well now. Anemia prevalence still very off. <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/maternal/model3%2C%20fixed%20hemoglobin%20weight%20experiment/hemoglobin%20and%20anemia.ipynb>`_
   * - I.3 hemoglobin distribution code update
     - Updated to mirrored_gumbel_ppf_2017 function
     - `Anemia prevalence is validating!! :) :) <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/maternal/model3%2C%20fixed%20hemoglobin%20weight%20experiment/hemoglobin%20and%20anemia%20distribution%20code%20update.ipynb>`_
   * - I.3.5.0 code refactor
     - Refactoring of model by James, need to check nothing broke.
     - `Validation notebooks for model 3.5.0 are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model3.5.0>`_. Maternal disorders and hemorrhage cause model, hemoglobin/anemia model, and pregnancy model are largely looking good. I noticed the following issues [1] postpartum duration in the outputs looks like it's just one week even though in the interactive sim it was consistently 5 weeks, [2] I had an issue with my validation code and we are actually *not* systematically overestimating pregnancy/maternal disorders at the population level, which means that the age shift implementation is not necessarily necessary for success, [3] it looks like the YLDs count data may not be properly stratified by cause... it looks like maternal disorders and anemia YLDs may be combined and labeled as maternal disorders only.
   * - I.3.5.1 code refactor with LBWSG gestational age
     - LBWSG exposure used to inform duration of pregnancy
     - `Validation notebooks for model 3.5.1 are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model3.5.1>`_. It appears that the duration of pregnancy, which used to be ~36 weeks, is now ~4 weeks. This is causing us to overestimate pregnancy incidence and outcomes related to it (like maternal disorders). 
   * - I.3.5.1: Bugfix and BMI
     - Fixes to pregnancy state durations and YLDs as well as implementation of BMI/Hemoglobin exposure
     - `Validation notebooks for model 3.5.1_bugfix are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model3.5.1_james_bugfix_and_bmi>`_. Postpartum duration now five weeks as expected. Pregnancy duration approximately equal to mean gestational age, as expected (but can be followed up with a more detailed validation in interactive simulation). YLDs behaving as expected. Joint BMI/hemoglobin exposure functioning as expected (although verification that exposure does not change with intervention scenarios should be done when ready).
   * - I.8 Intervention coverage
     - Implemented intervention coverage and scenarios
     - `Validation notebook for intervention coverage is available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/blob/main/validation/maternal/model8/intervention%20coverage.ipynb>`_. Issues added to the table below. BEP/MMS targeting looks good. Rate of scale-up looks good.
   * - I.8 Intervention coverage, bugfix
     - Run to fix issues identified with the previous run
     - `Validation notebooks for the intervention coverage bugfix run are available here <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model8_coverage_bugfix>`_. All issues appear resolved, with the exception of the request for output of intervention administration counts. Also of note, the "antenatal_iv_iron_invalid" and "postpartum_iv_iron_invalid" person time categories are inclusive of simulants with hemoglobin levels greater than 10 g/dL at the time of administration -- this makes direct V&V of the intervention targeting difficult, and it should be doublechecked when intervention administration counts are provided as an output and/or in the interactive simulation.
   * - I.8 intervention effects
     - Implement intervention effects and add intervention administration count outputs.

   * - `I.8 intervention effects bugfix <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model8_intervention_effects_bugfix>`_
     - Fix results processing and other bugs causing issues from above model version
     - Results look as expected :). No longer have unexpected differences in scenarios. Intervention effects on hemoglobin look good in the results outputs as well as in the interative sim.
   * - `I.5 Hemoglobin effects on maternal disorders <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model5_hgb_on_maternal_disorders>`_
     - All model 4 risk effects included now
     - Results look as expected :)
   * - I.8.2 2040 run
     - Add fertility component, run out to 2040, with risk effects and intervention models
     - `Results ran out to 2040 look as expected :) <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_research_iv_iron/tree/main/validation/maternal/model8.2_2040_run>`_. No longer have unexpected differences in scenarios. Intervention effects on hemoglobin look good in the results outputs as well as in the interative sim.

4.4 Desired outputs
-------------------

For model version I:

#. DALYs (YLLs and YLDs) due to a) maternal disorders, and b) anemia among a) pregnant, b) postpartum, and c) women of reproductive age
#. Severity-specific anemia prevalence during a) pregnancy, and b) the postpartum period
#. Average hemoglobin level among during a) pregnancy, and b) the postpartum period
#. Numbers of intervention regimens administered per a) 100,000 births, and b) 100,000 person years of women of reproductive age
#. Rates of each pregnancy outcome (live birth, stillbirth, abortion/miscarriage)

.. csv-table:: Maternal simulation output table
   :file: output_table.csv
   :header-rows: 1

**Outputs needed to inform the children under five simulation:**

The following ouputs should be a table including the following data for each live birth that occurs in the maternal simulation:

  - Input draw
  - Scenario
  - Random seed
  - Date of birth
  - Infant sex
  - :ref:`Joint categorical maternal BMI/anemia exposure <2019_risk_exposure_maternal_bmi_hgb>`
  - Birthweight exposure (either as sampled from GBD or post-adjustment due to the :ref:`correlation between maternal anemia/BMI and birhtweight <2019_risk_correlation_maternal_bmi_hgb_birthweight>`, in which case we would not need the joint categorical maternal BMI/anemia exposure above)
  - Gestational age exposure
  - Maternal supplementation coverage
  - Maternal antenatal IV iron coverage
  - Maternal postpartum IV iron coverage
  - Birthweight shift due to intervention coverage (NOTE: alternatively, this may be calculated in the child simulation from reported maternal intervention coverage values)
