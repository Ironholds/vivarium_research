1.0 Background
++++++++++++++

.. _ltbi1.1:

1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project used Vivarium framework to model the impact of treating LTBI on TB 
disease burden in five HBCs: India, South Africa, Philippines, Ethiopia, and 
Peru. The simulation is designed to estimate the extent to which the scale-up 
of TPT (6H and 3HP) reaching 95% of two high-risk populations (U5 HHC and PLHIV) 
in five HBCs improves health outcomes and reduces the disease burden of TB over 
a 5-year timeframe from 2020 to 2024, compared to a “business-as-usual” projection.

.. _ltbi1.2:

1.2 Literature review
---------------------
TB is the leading infectious cause of death globally, with particularly high 
disease burden in LMICs. The GBD 2017 study estimates that 1.9 billion people 
globally may harbor LTBI. [GBD-2017]_ TPT to reduce the risk of progression from 
LTBI to AcTB is important not only at the individual level but also at the population 
level in order to achieve TB elimination per the WHO End TB Strategy. WHO recommends 
that high-risk populations, such as children under 5 who are household contacts 
of persons with AcTB and people living with HIV, should receive TPT. [Global-Tuberculosis-Programme-2018]_ 
Sanofi has a long history in TB control and offers programmatic support with 
partners from the global Stop TB initiative. As part of its commitment to reduce 
the burden of TB, Sanofi developed 3HP which may increase adherence and treatment 
completion rates compared to 6H.


.. _ltbi2.0:

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To assess the impact of scaling up different treatments for LTBI on TB disease 
burden over five years. The project provides information on the relationship 
between different treatments and health outcomes such as the incidence of AcTB, 
deaths due to AcTB, and DALYs due to AcTB. The simulation forecasts a baseline 
and two intervention scenarios and the resulting health outcomes from years 2020 
through 2024 for five HBCs.

4.0 Intervention
++++++++++++++++
Scale-up of TPT coverage among two high-risk groups: U5 HHC and PLHIV.

.. _ltbi4.1:

4.1 Simulation scenarios
------------------------
The project compared the health outcomes in three scenarios:

 - **Baseline (6H as projected):** The baseline scenario projects GBD country-specific 
   demographic and disease trends into the future, as well as the historic coverage 
   of 6H treatment for U5 HHC and PLHIV, thus simulating what would happen if 
   these trends continue “business as usual.”

 - **Intervention scenario 1 (6H scale up):** This scenario is identical to the baseline 
   scenario but scales up 6H to reach 95% coverage for U5 HHC and PLHIV by 2025. 
   Thus, this scenario compares what would happen if countries were to increase 
   coverage, utilizing the same treatment regimen (6H) as seen in the baseline scenario.

 - **Intervention scenario 2 (3HP scale up):** This scenario is identical to the baseline 
   scenario but scales up 3HP to reach 95% coverage for U5 HHC and PLHIV by 2025. 
   Thus, this scenario compares what would happen if countries were to increase 
   coverage and utilize a new treatment regimen (3HP).

Treatment coverage in baseline and intervention scenarios:
 - `Baseline coverage data <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_csu_ltbi/blob/main/src/vivarium_csu_ltbi/data/baseline_coverage.csv>`_
 - `Intervention coverage data shift <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_csu_ltbi/blob/main/src/vivarium_csu_ltbi/data/intervention_coverage_shift.csv>`_
 - `Python code for adjusting coverage data <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium_csu_ltbi/blob/main/src/vivarium_csu_ltbi/data/adjust_coverage_shift_data.py>`_

The country- and risk-group-specific TPT coverage data is informed by 
country-specific National Strategic Plan and WHO global tuberculosis report.

.. _ltbi7.0:

7.0 Limitations
+++++++++++++++
 - We assume same efficacy for 6H and 3HP as literature evidence shows that 6HP 
   is non-inferior to 3HP on protecting patients progress from LTBI to active TB.
 - We assume perfect screening for active TB, which may not be the case in 
   reality (e.g., some individuals eligible for treatment may not receive it, 
   while others that have already progressed to active TB may receive treatment 
   for LTBI, depending on quality of screening).
 - We assume same TB disease duration for both HIV-positive population and 
   HIV-negative population.
 - We do not account for the reduced risk of onward TB transmission by people 
   treated for LTBI (“transmission dynamics”), which likely leads to a more 
   conservative estimate of treatment impact.
 - The relative risk of hosuehold contact exposure does not quantify the 
   relationship between TB risk, household size, and income.
 - Treatment for active TB is not assessed in this simulation.
 - Adverse events are not captured in this simulation.
 - Cost effectiveness analysis is not included in this simulation.
