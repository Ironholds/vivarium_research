Is this definition accurate, or do simulants < 6mo old also fall in this category?

Definition is based on the following lines in James' pseudocode for ""Summary of Vitamin A Intervention Algorithm"":

effectively_covered := individual is recieving fortification and it is affecting their probability of being vitamin a deficient.

Note: The simulant may not be receiving the full effect of iron fortification even if their household is receiving fortified food because 1) there is no effect before 6 months of age, and the full effect is only seen starting at 2 years of age, and 2) There is a time lag of 6 months to get the full age-dependent effect, even for simulants aged > 2 years

Question: Should we define 3 coverage groups instead, similar to vitamin A, in order to track some of these effects? E.g. covered_age_under_two and covered_age_two_and_up"
