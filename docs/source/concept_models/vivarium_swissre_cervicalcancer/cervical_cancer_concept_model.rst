1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project will generate forecasts of cervical cancer mortality and morbidity 
to allow Swiss Re to identify trends that are important to its business 
decision-making. IHME will produce both a baseline (business as usual) forecast, 
and an alternative scenario forecast in which key cervical cancer screening 
practice and HPV vaccination are implemented in a simulation framework. Baseline 
forecasts will incorporate expected trends in relevant risk factors. Alternative 
scenario forecasts will incorporate baseline forecasts and the expected impact of 
new screening technologies and vaccination. All forecasts will represent the Swiss 
Reâ€™s insured population from the weighted blend of Chinese provinces. Forecasts 
run from year 2020 to 2040.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IHME will estimate the yearly number of cases of benign and invasive cervical 
cancer detected under specific cervical cancer screening practices and the yearly 
number of deaths from undetected cervical cancer (both in unit of per 100,000 
insured person-years) in order to identify pay-out trends for cervical cancer 
claims.

4.1 Simulation scenarios
------------------------
**Baseline:** project existing level of HPV vaccination for women aged 15 to 44 
and cervical cancer screening for women aged 25 to 64, where:
 - Women without HPV infection are provided with cytology every three years
 - Women with HPV infection are provided cytology every year

**Alternative scenario:** by 2040, linear ramp up both HPV vaccination to cover 
90% of the women aged 15 to 44 in 2021-2025 and cervical cancer screening to cover 
70% of women aged 25 to 64 in 2021-2030, where:
 - Women without HPV infection are provided with cytology every three years
 - Women with HPV infection are provided cytology every year

5.3.2 Screening and detection model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

:underline:`I. Screening algorithm`

Cervical cancer screening algorithm was determined by three variables 
 1) Sex
 2) Age 
 3) Diagnosis of HPV infection
We will assign every simulant a cytology plus HPV co-test at the beginning of 
the simulation.

In initialization, We assume that
 - No one has prior knowledge of their disease status (and HPV status) on day one 
   of the simulation.
 - All simulants are buying insurance on day one of the simulation.
 - For simulants in cervical cancer (CC) state regardless of detection, they have 
   a transition rate of 0.1 (per person-year) of moving into a recovered (R) state; this results in an average duration in state CC of 10 years. People in state CC and R follow exactly the same screening algorithm, namely branch A, B, C, or D depending on their age, sex, and co-test result. Simulants do not ever make a second cervical cancer claim, therefore the negative screening results were expected for those in R state in order to avoid double counting the CI claim from detected cervical cancer.
 - The initial age of cervical cancer screening is set to 30 years old since HPV 
   co-test (cytology plus HPV test) is not recommended for women under 30 according to guidelines from American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.

:underline:`II. Screening schedule and attendance`

Probability of attending screening
 - Generate 1000 draws from normal distribution with mean=0.2, SD=0.002 for
   calculating the probability of simulants attending their first due screening.
 - If a simulant attended their last screening, they have 1.89 with 95%CI 1.06-2.49
   (Yan et al. 2017) more odds of attending the next screening than those who did
   not attend their last screening. 
Time to next scheduled screening
 - For those who are in Branch A (yearly cytology): use truncated normal
   distribution with mean 364 days, SD +/- 148 days, lower limit is 100 days,
   upper limit is 700 days.
 - For those in Branch B (every 3 years cytology): use truncated normal
   distribution with mean 1092 days, SD +/- 148 days, lower limit is 300 days,
   upper limit is 2100 days.

:underline:`III. Screening initialization`

The date of the first screening appointment (T_appt) for females at age between 
30 and 65 is determined as follows. We assume that each simulant had a previous 
appointment scheduled at some point before the simulation begins. We calculate 
the time between that past appointment and their next appointment (delta_T) using 
the methodology outlined in Section 5.3.2.II (Time to next scheduled screening). 
With a uniform distribution we randomly determine how far along that time interval 
between appointments each individual is (X) at the beginning of the simulation (
T_0). For females under 30 when the simulation begins the methodology is identical, 
except T_0 is the simulant's 30th birthday rather than the beginning of the 
simulation. No screening appointment will be initialized for males at any age, as 
well as females above 65.

 - prevalence: 19.0% with 95%CI 17.1-20.9 (Li et al. 2019)
 - Incidence: TBD
 - exposure distirbution: dichotomous
 - relative risk: RR = 16.2 with 95%CI 9.6 to 27.3 (Chen et al. 2011)

relevant formulas 
 (1) PAF = :math:`\frac{\text{Prev_HPV}(RR-1)}{\text{Prev_HPV}(RR-1)+1}`
 (2) :math:`\text{i_HPV+} =  i \times (1-PAF) \times RR`
 (3) :math:`\text{i_HPV-} =  i \times (1-PAF)`
