1.1 Project overview
--------------------
This project will generate forecasts of cervical cancer mortality and morbidity 
to allow Swiss Re to identify trends that are important to its business 
decision-making. IHME will produce both a baseline (business as usual) forecast, 
and an alternative scenario forecast in which key cervical cancer screening 
practice and HPV vaccination are implemented in a simulation framework. Baseline 
forecasts will incorporate expected trends in relevant risk factors. Alternative 
scenario forecasts will incorporate baseline forecasts and the expected impact of 
new screening technologies and vaccination. All forecasts will represent the Swiss 
Reâ€™s insured population from the weighted blend of Chinese provinces. Forecasts 
run from year 2020 to 2040.

2.0 Modeling aims and objectives
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
IHME will estimate the yearly number of cases of benign and invasive cervical 
cancer detected under specific cervical cancer screening practices and the yearly 
number of deaths from undetected cervical cancer (both in unit of per 100,000 
insured person-years) in order to identify pay-out trends for cervical cancer 
claims.

------------------------
**Baseline:** by 2040, project existing level of cervical cancer screening for 
women aged 21 to 65; linear ramp up HPV vaccination to cover 90% of the women 
aged 15 to 45 in 2030, then stay 90% in 2031-2040. Where:
 - Women without HPV infection are provided with cytology every three years
 - Women with HPV infection are provided cytology every year

**Alternative scenario:** by 2040, project existing level of HPV vaccination for 
women aged 15 to 45; linear ramp up cervical cancer screening to cover 70% of the 
women aged 21 to 65 in 2030, then stay 70% in 2031-2040. Where:
 - Women without HPV infection are provided with cytology every three years
 - Women with HPV infection are provided cytology every year

.. note::

 - Wang et al. reported a current cervical cancer screening coverage of 20.7% 
   with 95%CI 18.6-22.8 in China. We set it as 25% as we believe insured population has higher screening coverage than general population. 
 - No data has identified for current HPV vaccination rates in China. Temporarily 
   we will use 10%.
 - The target screening and HPV vaccination coverage in 2030 are guided by WHO 
   cervical cancer elimination strategy.

.. note::
 
 - Co-test (cytology plus HPV test) is not highly recommended for women under 
   30 according to guidelines from American Cancer Society and U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. To simply our screening algorithm, we decided to set initial age of the co-test to be the same as initial age of cytology alone, 
   namely 21 years old in our simulation.
 - The stand-in value of co-test sensitivity was extracted from Schiffman et al. 
   2018.
 - For now, follow-up test is not applicable with positive Cytology results. 
   Though colposcopy is recommended after diagnosis of benign/invasive cervical cancer, we could use colposcopy referral rate to determine treatment coverage for benign cervical cancer. 
 - Specificity for both co-test and cytology alone are set to 100% in our model. 

In initialization, We assume that
 - No one has prior knowledge of their disease status (and HPV status) on day one 
   of the simulation.
 - All simulants are buying insurance on day one of the simulation.
 - For simulants in cervical cancer (CC) state regardless of detection, they have 
   a transition rate of 0.1 (per person-year) of moving into a recovered (R) state; this results in an average duration in state CC of 10 years. People in state CC and R follow exactly the same screening algorithm, namely branch A, B, C, or D depending on their age, sex, and co-test result. Simulants do not ever make a second cervical cancer claim, therefore the negative screening results were expected for those in R state in order to avoid double counting the CI claim from detected cervical cancer.

:underline:`II. Screening schedule and attendance`

Probability of attending screening
 - Generate 1000 draws from normal distribution with mean=0.2, SD=0.002 for
   calculating the probability of simulants attending their first due screening.
 - If a simulant attended their last screening, they have 1.89 with 95%CI 1.06-2.49
   (Yan et al. 2017) more odds of attending the next screening than those who did
   not attend their last screening. 
Time to next scheduled screening
 - For those who are in Branch A (yearly cytology): use truncated normal
   distribution with mean 364 days, SD +/- 148 days, lower limit is 100 days,
   upper limit is 700 days.
 - For those in Branch B (every 3 years cytology): use truncated normal
   distribution with mean 1092 days, SD +/- 148 days, lower limit is 300 days,
   upper limit is 2100 days.

:underline:`III. Screening initialization`

The date of the first screening appointment (T_appt) for females at age between 
21 and 65 is determined as follows. We assume that each simulant had a previous 
appointment scheduled at some point before the simulation begins. We calculate 
the time between that past appointment and their next appointment (delta_T) using 
the methodology outlined in Section 5.3.2.II (Time to next scheduled screening). 
With a uniform distribution we randomly determine how far along that time interval 
between appointments each individual is (X) at the beginning of the simulation (
T_0). For females under 21 when the simulation begins the methodology is identical, 
except T_0 is the simulant's 30th birthday rather than the beginning of the 
simulation. No screening appointment will be initialized for males at any age, as 
well as females above 65.

 - prevalence: 19.0% with 95%CI 17.1-20.9 (Li et al. 2019)
 - Incidence: TBD
 - exposure distirbution: dichotomous
 - relative risk: RR = 16.2 with 95%CI 9.6 to 27.3 (Chen et al. 2011)

relevant formulas 
 (1) PAF = :math:`\frac{\text{Prev_HPV}(RR-1)}{\text{Prev_HPV}(RR-1)+1}`
 (2) :math:`\text{i_HPV+} =  i \times (1-PAF) \times RR`
 (3) :math:`\text{i_HPV-} =  i \times (1-PAF)`
