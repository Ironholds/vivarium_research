General Epidemiology Research Considerations and Best Practices
===============================================================

The purpose of this page is to document information that is relevant to conducting research on the simulation science team as it relates to Vivarium simulation model design. This page contains information that does not directly apply to Vivarium models, but is useful to understand the factors that affect the design behind them. This page is arranged in no particular order and topics can be added as they are encountered. The sections may be filled in as simulation science team members investigate the issues in their own projects and can include text from or links to existing documents that may address the topic.

Selecting Appropriate Data Sources

.. todo::

	- When can we reasonably conclude an association is causal?
	- When can we reasonably conclude a measure of effect is generalizable?
	- When can we reasonably conclude a study is or is not biased?
