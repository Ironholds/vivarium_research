Modeling Impairments
=================================

  :local:

What is an "impairment" and why might you model one?
----------------------------------------------------

- Include a link to :ref:`GBD health page <GBD_disease_health>` and the definition of an impairment 
- Highlight situations in which you might want to include an impairment in a model 

Comparing and Contrasting Impairment and Cause Models
-----------------------------------------------------

- Most of the modeling is very similar and we can utilize the cause model page 
- What is not applicable from that page? (e.g., certain data sources) 

Considerations when Modeling Impairments with Causes Together
-------------------------------------------------------------

- Cover the possibility of double counting 
- Recommend strategies to reduce bias
