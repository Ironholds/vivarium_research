BLISS Style Guide
==================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing style guide for incorporating inclusive 
language into our day-to-day work.


1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
As part of our team and organization's larger DEI efforts, we are committed to researching
and building a style guide so as to incorporate inclusive language into our day-to-day work
and to address the harmful conflation of sex and gender in public health research and data. 
We hope this page will serve as a useful guide to members of the Simulation Science team as
well as other teams at IHME!

On this page you will find our guiding principles, a glossary of commonly used terms related
to BLISS, recommendations for how to address sex/gender-related limitations in external data
sources, discussion of the implications of imperfect proxy measures with regards to sex/gender,
examples of how our team has incorporated BLISS into our work process, and more!

. list-table:: **What this is vs. What this isn't**
   :header-rows: 1

   * - This is...
     - This isn't...
   * - A ‘living’ document which will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving language and research practices. 
     - An immutable document that should be treated as all-knowing and final.
   * - An accessible guide intended for everyone’s use, regardless of your familiarity with inclusive language practices. 
     - An intimidating guide that is full of jargon and can only be used by DEI experts. 
   * - A safe space for people to make mistakes, ask questions, and learn new things! 
     - A space where people need to police what they are saying or how they are speaking for fear of judgment.
   * - Using our voice on the Simulation Science team to platform the terms we find most accurate and inclusive. 
     - Putting words into other people’s mouths (such as changing the gendered language in external data sources). 
   * - Gender inclusive.  
     - Gender neutral. We recognize that there are a variety of reasons why it is important to use person-first, inclusive language that does not invisibilize women in our conversations about public health. 


1.1 Guiding Principles
----------------------
In this section, we will outline the guiding principles of BLISS.

1.2 Glossary of General Terminology
-----------------------------------
In this section, we will create a glossary of general terminology that will be used 
throughout this style guide (e.g., for starters, we should explicitly define sex and 
gender; SGM) (include visual of 'Do's and Don'ts)

2.0 Acknowledging Limitations in Peer Research
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will discuss how to acknowledge limitations in external data sources
used in our research, the different scenarios in which sex/gender conflation may occur and
how to appropriately articulate these issues in our reports, publications, and other work.  

2.1 Terminology 
---------------

2.2 Methodology
---------------

2.2.1 Imperfect Proxies 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Discuss the implications of imperfect proxy measures and how they correspond to what is
exactly being measured.  

3.0 Discussing Simulation Science Findings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will elaborate on how to incorporate BLISS principles into our own 
research processes and calculations.  

3.1 Table Presentation
----------------------

3.2 Measurement Error
---------------------
In this section, we will elaborate on how misinterpretations of sex/gender might affect 
results.

3.3 Other Gender-Inclusive Guides
---------------------------------

- DEI Research Guide
- Design team guidelines for discussing gender, sex, and sexuality
- Gates Foundation
- World Health Organization


4.0 BLISS in Action 
+++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will use case studies to explore the different ways in which 
BLISS principles can be practically applied to specific areas of public health research. 
Elaborate on lessons learned from other projects in which we've used BLISS (e.g., VEHSS
DR paper; IV Iron communications and IDM Symposium)
