BLISS Style Guide
==================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing style guide for incorporating inclusive 
language into our day-to-day work.


1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
Add an introductory paragraph here (include visual of 'What this is vs. what this isn't').

1.1 Guiding Principles
----------------------

Our guiding principles for this document can be summarized in three points:  

**1. This work is important**

Inclusive language use is important, and we want to begin by acknowledging the 
potential harm that using gendered language can create. ‘Sex’ and ‘gender’ are 
not synonymous, unidimensional traits. [Bauer_2022]_ acknowledges this and explains 
how common sex and gender proxies such as chromosomes or sex organs are imperfect 
and not fully inclusive of lived experiences.  

Using imperfect proxies can create real harm by alienating individuals, and by 
creating invalid research. People who are not cisgendered (a diverse group including 
intersex, nonbinary, transgender and other gender nonconforming individuals) experience 
gendered language frequently which can be alienating and cause harm. These individuals 
might be less likely to interact with healthcare, see themselves in research, and lose 
opportunities as a result. In an effort to work toward institution-wide DEI goals and 
advance our team’s research and publications, we created this guide to explore the 
concepts of sex and gender and offer inclusive language alternatives.  

One example of how proxy measures can affect the validity of research is in [Bauer_2022]_, 
where researchers used 'women' as a proxy for people with a uterus. The researchers were 
trying to find the incidence of uterine cancer, but by using 'women' as the denominator, 
even though not all women have a uterus, cancer rates were thought to be lower than was true 
in real lif. This was especially prominent in Black women who are more likely to have had 
a hysterectomy. This example highlights the importance of using a measure that is actually 
tied to the research question.  

A second example of the potential impact on research validity is equating differences in 
results to only sex or gender. As explained in [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_, both sex and gender 
can lead to biological changes and untangling these pathways is complex or impossible. Often, 
researchers will report findings as "sex differences" implying that they are a result of sex, 
when the possibility that gendered behavior or norms was the cause was never explored. 

Lastly, we hope to inspire change in other researchers by presenting our studies with gender 
inclusive language and model practices we believe in. For all of these reasons, we feel this 
guide is very important.  

**2. This work is evolving**

Language is constantly evolving, so there is rarely a single “right” choice and the accepted 
choice may evolve over time. Therefore, this guide will be a living document that we will 
regularly review and update. We will hold ourselves accountable for aligning the guide with 
the current preferred language, terminology and approaches.  

While we hope this can be up to date and comprehensive, no guide can anticipate every use case, 
recognize every limitation, or be applicable to every research question. We aim to provide enough 
information that users can understand the spirit of the guide and apply that to their unique needs.  

**3. This is work**

We acknowledge that there is a cost associated with a transition to gender inclusive language 
practices from standard, gendered language. Although using gender inclusive language is work, 
we highlight here that there are many benefits to incorporating more inclusive language into 
everyday public health research practices.  

Gender inclusive language can often by longer or more verbose than gendered language, but we 
believe specificity is more important than brevity. We seek to include all groups and identities 
in our language, even if that means using more words! For example, we would rather use terms like 
"women and people" to describe pregnancy related issues since this is inclusive of all who can get 
pregnant while not invisibilizing women.

The ever-evolving nature of the work means that this guide is for everyone! You don’t have to be 
an expert; this is meant to be accessible for all people. Wherever you are in the learning 
journey, this guide is intended to be a clear, helpful resource.  

We’re not going to put any words into other people’s mouths, but we will use our own voice to do 
the work and use the terms we find most accurate and inclusive.  

1.2 Glossary of General Terminology
-----------------------------------
In this section, we will create a glossary of general terminology that will be used 
throughout this style guide (e.g., for starters, we should explicitly define sex and 
gender; SGM) (include visual of 'Do's and Don'ts)

2.0 Acknowledging Limitations in Peer Research
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will discuss how to acknowledge limitations in external data sources
used in our research, the different scenarios in which sex/gender conflation may occur and
how to appropriately articulate these issues in our reports, publications, and other work.  

2.1 Terminology 
---------------

2.2 Methodology
---------------

2.2.1 Imperfect Proxies 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Discuss the implications of imperfect proxy measures and how they correspond to what is
exactly being measured.  

3.0 Discussing Simulation Science Findings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will elaborate on how to incorporate BLISS principles into our own 
research processes and calculations.  

3.1 Table Presentation
----------------------

3.2 Measurement Error
---------------------
In this section, we will elaborate on how misinterpretations of sex/gender might affect 
results.

3.3 Other Gender-Inclusive Guides
---------------------------------

- DEI Research Guide
- Design team guidelines for discussing gender, sex, and sexuality
- Gates Foundation
- World Health Organization


4.0 BLISS in Action 
+++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will use case studies to explore the different ways in which 
BLISS principles can be practically applied to specific areas of public health research. 
Elaborate on lessons learned from other projects in which we've used BLISS (e.g., VEHSS
DR paper; IV Iron communications and IDM Symposium)
