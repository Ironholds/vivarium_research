BLISS Style Guide
==================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing style guide for incorporating inclusive 
language into our day-to-day work.


1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
Add an introductory paragraph here (include visual of 'What this is vs. what this isn't').

1.1 Guiding Principles
----------------------
In this section, we will outline the guiding principles of BLISS.

1.2 Glossary of General Terminology
-----------------------------------
In this section, we will create a glossary of general terminology that will be used 
throughout this style guide (e.g., for starters, we should explicitly define sex and 
gender; SGM) (include visual of 'Do's and Don'ts)

2.0 Acknowledging Limitations in Peer Research
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will discuss how to acknowledge limitations in external data sources
used in our research, the different scenarios in which sex/gender conflation may occur and
how to appropriately articulate these issues in our reports, publications, and other work.  

2.1 Terminology 
---------------

2.2 Methodology
---------------

2.2.1 Imperfect Proxies 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Discuss the implications of imperfect proxy measures and how they correspond to what is
exactly being measured.  

3.0 Discussing Simulation Science Findings
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will elaborate on how to incorporate BLISS principles into our own 
research processes and calculations.  

3.1 Table Presentation
----------------------

3.2 Measurement Error
---------------------
In this section, we will elaborate on how misinterpretations of sex/gender might affect 
results.

3.3 Other Gender-Inclusive Guides
---------------------------------

- DEI Research Guide
- Design team guidelines for discussing gender, sex, and sexuality
- Gates Foundation
- World Health Organization


4.0 BLISS in Action 
+++++++++++++++++++
In this section, we will use case studies to explore the different ways in which 
BLISS principles can be practically applied to specific areas of public health research. 
Elaborate on lessons learned from other projects in which we've used BLISS (e.g., VEHSS
DR paper; IV Iron communications and IDM Symposium)
