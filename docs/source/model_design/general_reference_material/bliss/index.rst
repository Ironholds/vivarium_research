BLISS Style Guide
==================

Building Language Inclusivity into Simulation Science (BLISS) is an important part of
our team's work! Here you will find our ongoing style guide for incorporating inclusive 
language into our day-to-day work.


1.0 Overview 
++++++++++++
As part of our team and organization's larger DEI efforts, we are committed to researching
and building a style guide so as to incorporate inclusive language into our day-to-day work
and to address the harmful conflation of sex and gender in public health research and data. 
We hope this page will serve as a useful guide to members of the Simulation Science team as
well as other teams at IHME!

On this page you will find our guiding principles, a glossary of commonly used terms related
to BLISS, recommendations for how to address sex/gender-related limitations in external data
sources, discussion of the implications of imperfect proxy measures with regards to sex/gender,
examples of how our team has incorporated BLISS into our work process, and more!

   * - This is...
     - This isn't...
   * - A ‘living’ document which will be regularly reviewed and updated to reflect evolving language and research practices. 
     - An immutable document that should be treated as all-knowing and final.
   * - An accessible guide intended for everyone’s use, regardless of your familiarity with inclusive language practices. 
     - An intimidating guide that is full of jargon and can only be used by DEI experts. 
   * - A safe space for people to make mistakes, ask questions, and learn new things! 
     - A space where people need to police what they are saying or how they are speaking for fear of judgment.
   * - Using our voice on the Simulation Science team to platform the terms we find most accurate and inclusive. 
     - Putting words into other people’s mouths (such as changing the gendered language in external data sources). 
   * - Gender inclusive.  
     - Gender neutral. We recognize that there are a variety of reasons why it is important to use person-first, inclusive language that does not invisibilize women in our conversations about public health. 


1.1 Guiding Principles
----------------------

Our guiding principles for this document can be summarized in three points:  

**1. This work is important**

Inclusive language use is important, and we want to begin by acknowledging the 
potential harm that using gendered language can create. ‘Sex’ and ‘gender’ are 
not synonymous, unidimensional traits. [Bauer_2022]_ acknowledges this and explains 
how common sex and gender proxies such as chromosomes or sex organs are imperfect 
and not fully inclusive of lived experiences.  

Using imperfect proxies and gendered language can create harm by alienating individuals, and by 
creating invalid research. People who are intersex, transgender, nonbinary, and/or 
have other gender-nonconforming identities experience harm from gendered language in a 
number of ways, including documented reductions in interactions 
with healthcare, not being included in research, and lost 
opportunities. In an effort to work toward institution-wide DEI goals and 
advance our team’s research and publications, we created this guide to explore the 
concepts of sex and gender and offer inclusive language alternatives.  

One example of how proxy measures can affect the validity of research is in [Bauer_2022]_, 
where researchers used 'women' as a proxy for people with a uterus. The researchers were 
trying to find the incidence of uterine cancer, but by using 'women' as the denominator, 
even though not all women have a uterus, cancer rates were thought to be lower than was true 
in real life. This was especially prominent for Black women who are more likely to have had 
a hysterectomy. This example highlights the importance of using a measure that is actually 
tied to the research question.  

A second example of the potential impact on research validity is equating differences in 
results to only sex or gender. As explained in [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_, both sex and gender 
can lead to biological changes and untangling these pathways is complex or impossible. Often, 
researchers will report findings as "sex differences," implying that they are a result of sex, 
without exploring the role of gendered behavior or norms. 

Lastly, we hope to inspire change in other researchers by presenting our studies with gender 
inclusive language and model practices we believe in. For all of these reasons, we feel this 
guide is very important.  

**2. This work is evolving**

Language is constantly evolving, so there is rarely a single “right” choice and the accepted 
choice may evolve over time. Therefore, this guide will be a living document that we will 
regularly review and update. We will hold ourselves accountable for aligning the guide with 
the current preferred language, terminology and approaches.  

While we hope this can be up-to-date and comprehensive, no guide can anticipate every use case, 
recognize every limitation, or be applicable to every research question. We aim to provide enough 
information that users can understand the spirit of the guide and apply that to their unique needs.  

**3. This is work**

We acknowledge that there is a cost associated with a transition to gender inclusive language 
practices from standard, gendered language. Although using gender inclusive language is work, 
we highlight here that there are many benefits to incorporating more inclusive language into 
everyday public health research practices.  

Gender inclusive language can often be longer or more verbose than gendered language, but we 
believe specificity is more important than brevity. We seek to include all groups and identities 
in our language, even if that means using more words! For example, we would rather use terms like 
"women and people" to describe pregnancy related issues since this is inclusive of all who can get 
pregnant while not invisibilizing women.

The ever-evolving nature of the work means that this guide is for everyone! You don’t have to be 
an expert; this is meant to be accessible for all people. Wherever you are in the learning 
journey, this guide is intended to be a clear, helpful resource.  

We’re not going to put any words into other people’s mouths, but we will use our own voice to do 
the work and use the terms we find most accurate and inclusive.  

1.2 Glossary of General Terminology
-----------------------------------
In this section, you will find a glossary of general terminology that will be used 
throughout this style guide. 

.. list-table:: **Glossary**
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Term
     - Definition
   * - Sex
     - According to [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_, *sex* refers to biological attributes and 
     functions associated with chromosomal makeup, endocrine function, reproductive organs,
     secondary sex characteristics, and other physiological and morphological variations 
     and processes not directly related to reproduction (e.g., body size and composition,
     metabolic function, or organ function).
   * - Gender
     - *Gender*, on the other hand, is a sociocultural construct that refers to social norms,
     behaviors, and institutional structures that shape any individual's experiences, exposures,
     and access to power and resources, as well as one's internal sense of self as a gendered 
     individual [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_. 
   * - Sexual and gender minority (SGM) 
     - An umbrella term that includes (but is not limited to) individuals that are two-spirit, 
     intersex, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, non-binary, asexual, or have other gender 
     non-conforming identities.
   * - Nondifferentiated sex/gender measure
     - A useful hybrid term that reflects the dynamic relationship that exists between sex and gender
     and acknowledges the common conflation between sex and gender in public health research and 
     data [Ritz_and_Greaves_2022]_.
