Modeling Risk Factors
=====================

.. todo::

  Add description of what's in this document.

  Also see the following sections in :ref:`Modeling Causes <models_cause>`:

  * Learning objectives
  * Why do we want a document that describes each cause model?

  It looks like most of that content is generalizable to both risks and causes.
  Should we put similar sections in both documents, or pull them out into a more
  general document about designing Vivarium models?

  On the other hand, it looks like the following sections in :ref:`Modeling
  Causes <models_cause>` have details that are specific to causes, but should
  have analogues for risks in this document:

  * How is a cause model incorporated into a larger model?
  * What does a model document look like?
