Vivarium Model Considerations and Best Practices
================================================

The purpose of this page is to document information that is relevant to designing Vivarium simulation models as a whole, rather than information specific to particular sub-components of Vivarium simulations. 

Outline of topics:

- Common random numbers 
		- Between model scenarios
		- Between model locations
		- Between model parameters
- Statistical distributions of uncertainty
	- Uniform
	- Normal/Truncated normal
	- Beta
	- Ensemble
- When to choose causal associations versus correlations in the context of a Vivarium concept model
