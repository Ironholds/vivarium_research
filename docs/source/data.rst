Currently, Vivarium utilizes GBD 2017 data. Understanding what data is available
from this round and what modeling process produced it is a difficult task. The
interface in Vivarium Inputs provides a function for pulling GBD 2017 data,
but learning about it and understanding potential issues requires more effort.
You may need to talk to GBD researchers, but the links below can help.

- `GBD sources <http://pypi.services.ihme.washington.edu/docs/get_draws/latest-pre/sources.html>`_
- `GBD trainings <https://hub.ihme.washington.edu/pages/viewpage.action?spaceKey=gbd2017&title=GBD+2017+Trainings>`_

Internal GBD teams also maintain up-to-date information scattered across a
variety of R Shiny apps. A few are listed below. They require VPN access.
